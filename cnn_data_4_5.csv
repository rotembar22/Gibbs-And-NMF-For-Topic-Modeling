https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/media/japan-abe-shinzo-name-intl-hnk/index.html,Japan asked the international media to change how we write their names. No one listened,"In the new system ""Canton becomes Guangzhou and Tientsin becomes Tianjin."" Most importantly, the newspaper would now refer to the country's capital as Beijing, not Peking.  This was a step too far for some American publications. In an article on Pinyin around this time, the Chicago Tribune said that while it would be adopting the system for most Chinese words, some names had ""become so ingrained in our usage that we can't get used to new ones.""  The Tribune would continue using Peking into the 1990s, though by then it was something of an outlier. The New York Times noted in 1986 — while announcing its adoption of Beijing — that the name ""has now become equally familiar"" as the old moniker. Now, Japan wants its turn. As the country marked the dawn of the Reiwa Era last year with the coronation of Emperor Naruhito, its foreign ministry felt it was an opportune time to request that the names of Japanese officials be written differently.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's name, for example, would become Abe Shinzo, with his family name coming before his given name — just as the international media prints the names of Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But if history is any guide, the Japanese government may have a long wait ahead of it before the English-language media conforms to its request.  What's in a name? The family-name-first format has always been used in Japanese. But during the Meiji Era that began in 1868, the order was reversed in English to begin with the given name, a format more familiar in the West.  While that decision may have made life easier for some 19th century Western diplomats, Japan's neighbors soon proved that foreigners could (for the most part) handle writing the ""last name"" first. And for almost two decades now Tokyo has been trying to reverse the Meiji reversal. Last year's request to the international media was only the latest attempt.  Japan is ""being hoisted on its own petard,"" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Tokyo's Temple University. He added that in the past, the country was ""eager to distance itself from its neighbors so as not to be confused with them."" Now, though, it wants the West to treat it the same.  It's not only foreigners who are slow to change, however. Many Japanese are accustomed to writing their names in English with the family name last, and while the government has changed how it refers to the Prime Minister and other officials, the domestic English language press still largely uses ""Shinzo Abe.""  A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred CNN to a notice issued in November 2019 that all government agencies would adopt the family name first format from January 1. He added that ""we are requesting that media companies consider using family name first with regard to Japanese names, as long as it does not cause any issues, but it is up to each company what decision they will make.""  Even as Japan achieves some consistency across its own government, Peking became Beijing in the American press thanks largely to the widespread adoption of the new name (and Pinyin generally) by the US State Department. Japan may need to lobby diplomats to make the change before it can get journalists to follow suit. Inertia loop In 1979, changing from Peking to Beijing required newspapers to print an explanation for their readers — but at least they didn't have to go back in the archive and fix all previous mentions. Today, adopting a new format for ""Abe Shinzo,"" let alone all Japanese names, would require editing every published mention of the politician, or else tolerating an inconsistency that could confuse readers (and the search engines websites rely on for much of their traffic).   ""The audience likes consistency, so you have to figure out how seamlessly (and consistently) a style change can be integrated,"" said Doris Truong, director of training and diversity at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in the United States. For now, most media outlets are unwilling to make a change if no one else is, creating an inertia loop whereby inaction begets inaction. CNN Business could not find any major publication which refers to the Japanese prime minister as ""Abe Shinzo,"" and no outlet which responded to a request for comment suggested such a switch was imminent. Of major outlets, Japan's foreign ministry noted that Economist has updated its style.  ""We have not received a request, and at this time we have no plans to change long-standing and widely accepted style,"" said the Associated Press.  The UK-based Guardian told CNN Business that ""similar to other media outlets, our house style is to generally follow first name-surname. As with anything related to style, this is something we continue to research and review over time."" Reuters said it was ""aware of the preference expressed by the Abe government for names to be expressed in English as they are in Japanese with family name first. Nevertheless, the opposite convention remains widespread in Japanese business and society and more familiar for international readers."" A representative for CNN said the company currently uses ""the given name first, surname second form for Japanese names, as this is the form that tends to be used by Japanese officials in communications in English.""  ""However, styles evolve, and in the event of a formal request from the Japanese government or other significant change we would of course reconsider this,"" they added.  On Wikipedia, perhaps the first port of call for most people trying to work out if it is ""Mr. Shinzo"" or ""Mr. Abe,"" an intense debate ensued last year. Editors eventually decided against making any change.  Though some supported changing the title of the prime minister's page to ""Abe Shinzo,"" the majority preferred to wait and see. One editor wrote ""this should only change if/when most English-language sources follow suit.""  Truong said it may be worthwhile for the media ""to have a wider discussion about any nations that use last/first and determining whether imposing Western standards of first/last give those populations the respect and agency they deserve.""  For now however, it appears that, should the Tokyo Olympics go ahead, the man leading the celebrations will remain — as far as English-language media is concerned — ""Shinzo Abe."" ",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/perspectives/us-oil-saudi-arabia-russia/index.html,The United States is still too reliant on oil,"Saudi Arabia's decision to open its taps comes after talks with OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, collapsed last week. Prices had already been sliding dangerously as coronavirus fears battered global demand for oil. Then Saudi Arabia escalated things when it slashed the price of its exports by $6 to $8 per barrel and announced it will also increase production by 2.5 million barrels per day by April 1. Brent crude, the international benchmark oil price, fell by more than 9% last week to $45.27 a barrel when OPEC and non-OPEC members failed to agree on a deal. And the day after Saudi Arabia announced its price war, US crude prices toppled to $31.13 per barrel, notching its worst one-day loss since 1991.  While the global decline in oil prices will certainly cause pain for both Saudi Arabia and Russia, its impact on US oil producers, especially many of the smaller shale producers, could be especially severe. Even major companies like Chevron and Exxon saw their stocks fall, while Occidental Petroleum — which took on significant debt to acquire a different US producer in 2019 — announced a major cut to its dividend.  The Trump administration is surely sympathetic to the plight of US shale producers suffering from decisions made in Saudi Arabia and Russia — both of whom would like nothing better than to see their US competitors go under. President Trump has made promoting America's new-found energy independence a major priority, and his vitriol against OPEC is well-known. It wouldn't be surprising if the White House sought federal aid for shale companies buffeted by the price fallout.  While such a move would be welcome amongst hurting shale producers and the tens of thousands of people that the industry employs, it would be a stopgap measure, at best. The shale revolution has been good for America, but it has only reduced — not ended — our reliance on foreign producers. As Riyadh and Moscow just demonstrated, authoritarian regimes overseas still have the capability to wield the oil weapon against the United States, albeit with low prices now instead of high prices.  If the United States really wants to attain energy independence, becoming a net exporter of oil isn't enough. What America needs is a comprehensive vision for energy security, one that goes beyond fossil fuel independence.  This plan should entail sustained investment in alternative fuel sources and technologies, such as ethanol and electricity, as well as policies to promote a competitive marketplace for such fuels that can break gasoline's near monopoly on the US transportation sector. A robust market for alternative fuels will buttress US companies and consumers from potentially destabilizing oil market fluctuations driven by hostile foreign powers.  An American vision for true energy independence should also prioritize increasing ownership of electric vehicles and enact policies that would incentivize this, including giving subsidies or indexing tax credits for electric vehicles. Government funding for R&D efforts at electric-vehicle companies would also provide EV manufacturers, like Tesla or Lucid Motors, additional resources to design more cost-effective models that will be accessible to a larger segment of the population. In tandem, the government must invest in building a national, well-connected charging infrastructure network that will operationalize extended EV usage. Investments to improve battery storage technology and reduce replacement costs will further encourage consumers to adopt electric vehicles.  The dynamics of America's reliance on oil may have changed. We are no longer totally beholden to hostile foreign producers for vital energy imports, but these producers' actions have ripple effects on global markets that continue to hurt us. If the United States really wants to be energy independent, it must look toward preparing for a post-oil future. ",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/investing/global-stocks-monday/index.html,Global stocks and US futures rise as policymakers try to blunt the coronavirus pain,"The promise of unlimited support for markets from the US Federal Reserve and hope that Congress is moving towards a huge fiscal stimulus package boosted US futures overnight as well as markets in Europe and Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 (N225) gained 7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) added 4.4% and the Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) was up 2.3%. South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) surged 8.6% after the country's government announced that it will double its emergency financial support for businesses to 100 trillion Korean won ($80 billion). In Europe, the FTSE 100 (UKX) gained nearly 4% in early trading. France's CAC 40 (CAC40) advanced 3.9% while Germany's DAX (DAX) rose by more than 5%. Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz told CNN on Monday that the government would do whatever it takes for as long as necessary to protect Europe's biggest economy.  Stocks in Spain and Italy, which have been hard hit by the pandemic, also surged.  The rally comes on the heels of weeks of brutal trading that has wiped tens of trillions of dollars off the value of  stocks as countries around the world put their populations on lockdown in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. A global recession is now expected in 2020.  The United Kingdom became the latest major economy to adopt draconian measures on Monday when it ordered people to stay at home.  On Tuesday, investors seized on some signs of progress on a massive rescue package in the United States, where negotiations continue in Congress over how to allocate $2 trillion in stimulus. That comes after the Federal Reserve announced essentially unlimited bond-buying, three new credit facilities and a Main Street lending program. ""Asian investors like what they see from an all-in Fed,"" wrote Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a Tuesday research note.  US stocks ended Monday in the red after the stimulus bill failed to move forward, but futures moved higher overnight. Dow (INDU) futures were last up nearly 800 points, or about 4.3%. S&P 500 (SPX) futures gained 4.4% and Nasdaq (COMP) futures increased 4.3%. Even with Tuesday's gains, most global indexes remain in a bear market. ""I think it's too early to call the bottom quite yet,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""It still isn't clear how bad the economic damage is likely to be and while a rally today is to be welcomed, the possibility of another leg lower remains a real possibility."" Innes said he thinks the actions from the Fed ""will effectively paper over the cracks for now."" But as more data that captures the severity of the economic tumult rolls in, he said, ""the big equity market buyers will stay in cash and remain nervous about stepping back in until data improves."" Separately, shares in Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (SFTBY SOFTBANK) skyrocketed 17% on Tuesday in Tokyo, adding to the stock's big gains on Monday. Investors are cheering the company's surprise announcement that it will sell $41 billion worth of assets to buy back shares and reduce debt. SoftBank stock is still down more than 19% for the year.  — CNN's Yoonjung Seo in Seoul, Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong, and Matt Egan in New York contributed to this report.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/economy/china-economy-coronavirus/index.html,China is trying to revive its economy without risking more lives. The world is watching,"The country where the pandemic began was almost completely shut down in late January as the number of coronavirus cases mounted. The drastic measures appear to have brought the virus under control: Locally transmitted infections have plummeted, and a lockdown on most of Hubei province — ground zero of the pandemic — is being lifted this week.  But the lockdown also brought activity in much of the world's second biggest economy to a standstill for weeks on end, and is likely to result in China's first contraction in decades. Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently forecast that China's GDP may fall by 9% in the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2019. The Chinese government knows that its actions to contain the virus came at the expense of the country's economic health. Now authorities are trying to ensure that those consequences are short lived.  ""The economic losses have become intolerable,"" Xingdong (XD) Chen, chief China economist for BNP Paribas, told CNN Business, adding that the government has to balance resuming work while remaining vigilant. ""I don't think it is right to restart business and production only when the virus has totally disappeared."" Western nations are also weighing these enormous tradeoffs while the virus remains a global threat. In the United States — where unlike China, cases have yet to peak — President Donald Trump on Monday argued the country will have to reopen for business ""very soon"" even though the virus is ""going to be bad."" Beijing, meanwhile, has embarked on a campaign — backed by state-media — to persuade companies that life is returning to normal.  But restarting factories and returning to work puts China on a precarious path. The pandemic is still wreaking havoc on the rest of the world, raising fears of a potential second wave of infections as people return from overseas and bring the virus with them. Add to that the risk of another outbreak if the virus hasn't been totally eradicated in local communities. ""In our view, the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 in China is rising,"" wrote Ting Lu, chief China economist for Nomura, in a recent report.  Restarting the economic engines China's plan to save the economy rests on a slew of policies and campaigns meant to push people back to work, encourage business confidence at home and abroad, and protect as many companies from failing as possible. In addition to the billions of dollars Beijing is spending on medical supplies and treatment, the government has pumped money into infrastructure projects to create jobs. It has also reduced taxes on small businesses and required banks to defer loan payments for troubled households or companies as a way to help them survive the economic fallout. Chinese state media is amplifying the message that the country can bounce back strongly — and that foreign companies and investors shouldn't be scared off, either. China's official news agency Xinhua in late February called Tesla (TSLA) a symbol of ""foreign business confidence in China"" after the US electric automaker reopened its massive Shanghai factory and announced plans to expand production capacity. Now that the number of infections has slowed, many parts of the country are lifting their lockdowns, removing road blockades and allowing people to travel more freely in areas where the virus appears to have run its course — as long as they have documented proof that they are healthy. In some cases, the government is making special arrangements for workers. For example, Beijing has ordered railway and airline companies to organize special trains and flights to carry migrant workers from ""the door of their house to the gate of the factory,"" according to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. China's 290 million migrant workers, who perform low paying but vital work, are critical drivers of the economy. And authorities in Hubei province, where the virus first broke out, said Tuesday that healthy migrant workers can be taken back to their places of work beginning later this week. Beijing says its campaign is already working. More than 90% of industrial companies in most provinces were up and running as of March 17, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Smaller companies are finding it harder, though — only 60% of small and medium-sized enterprises were open by the middle of March, according to government data. Risk avoidance hampers efforts  Beijing has also acknowledged that its attempt to get back to normal is risky. The global pandemic is still accelerating, and China is still reporting dozens of cases per day — most of which are people who came to mainland China from other countries. Fears of a second wave are also growing in Hong Kong, where new cases have increased rapidly, with many imported from overseas. A statement released this week by Beijing's virus taskforce noted that ""the risks for sporadic infections and localized outbreaks have not gone away."" Some businesses have rushed back to work too soon, complicating the recovery efforts. A top titanium producer restarted its factories in February, only to halt work again because workers were infected. Analysts and academics, meanwhile, warn that the intense pressure to resume work, coupled with fear of a second outbreak, might be creating a distorted picture of what's really happening on the ground. Some companies in the eastern province of Zhejiang — where the government said almost all industrial work has resumed — have been turning on the lights and letting machines run idle so that it appears to government officials that they're using electricity, according to the Chinese media outlets Caijing and Caixin. Those manufacturers are struggling to resume production because of worker shortages, according to Caijing, while Caixin added that some local governments are reluctant to order companies back to work because they fear mass gatherings will lead to another outbreak. ""Because local officials and factories know that they would be punished severely by the government for allowing new infections to spread, they have played it safe by delaying the resumption of [real] economic activities,"" said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at San Diego and the author of ""Economic Shocks and Authoritarian Stability."" ""The threat of harsh punishment works to enforce self-quarantine, but will lead to risk avoidance behavior in the aftermath,"" he said. Faulty data about how much power companies are using has also been criticized heavily within China. Cao Heping, an economics professor at Peking University, warned in an article published earlier this month that faking data about returning to work would be fatal to China's plans for an economic recovery.  If local businesses or authorities continue to fake data to give the impression of activity and do not actually resume production, it would be impossible for the country's economy to grow at a strong pace this year, he said. China could provide some answers While the real extent of China's economic restart is still uncertain, its ability to move past the initial phase of the outbreak could provide some hope — and a partial blueprint — for countries that are still in crisis mode.  Officials around the world are agonizing over how long to maintain curfews and quarantines that are essential to curb the pandemic but which are tipping the world into a deep recession, possibly even an economic depression. Even democratic governments might be able to emulate some of China's policies, including its plans to invest in infrastructure projects and healthcare systems, along with the tax cuts it is rolling out to fuel private demand.  ""I think we will see most governments around the world implementing these kinds of stimulus policies,"" said David Dollar, a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.  But China's blueprint might only provide so much help, particularly for western economies that operate under less centralized government control.  Shih, the University of California professor, pointed out that China has an extensive system of state-owned enterprises that mobilized workers to help enforce the government's quarantine rules. One expert pointed out that China's state-funded infrastructure system is also much larger than in other developed countries, and can be relied on as a major economic booster. ""The Chinese are resuming some large infrastructure projects which are largely funded by the state,"" said Xiaobo Lü, a professor of political science at Barnard College at Columbia University, who added that sectors served by those projects are fairly easy to restart and can absorb idle labor.  By contrast, the private sector is more important in most Western economies, Lü and Shih said, where state orders aren't as effective. ""The challenge in the West will be to incentivize people to go out to restaurants, theaters, and sporting events, rather than to get workers back to the factories,"" said Shih. ""The challenge is very different and consumer dependent.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/bailout-buybacks-airlines-boeing/index.html,Companies that binged on buybacks now seek bailouts from taxpayers,"Now, some of the same companies that binged on buybacks are in line to receive taxpayer-funded bailouts to keep them alive.   Boeing (BA), for example, spent $11.7 billion over the past two years on repurchasing stock before suspending buybacks in April 2019 because of the 737 Max crisis. The aerospace behemoth is now requesting $60 billion in federal assistance as the coronavirus crisis has crushed its customers and forced factories to shut down. Southwest Airlines (LUV) spent $2 billion on share buybacks in 2019. Similarly, last year American Airlines Group  (AAL)also spent $1.1 billion to repurchase its stock at an average cost of $32.09 per share. American Airlines shares closed Monday at just $10.   Now the airline industry is seeking $50 billion in federal help as it fights for survival during a stunning decline in worldwide travel.  Even in early March, as the coronavirus crisis mounted, Hilton (HLT) announced $2 billion of buybacks. Days later, Hilton withdrew its earnings outlook. The hotel industry is now seeking some $150 billion in federal assistance as the coronavirus has caused occupancy rates to crash.   This situation is only deepening the backlash against buybacks, paving the way for bipartisan restrictions against share repurchases by bailed-out companies. And it further exposes the shortfalls of President Donald Trump's corporate tax overhaul, which sparked a flurry of buybacks but not the promised business investment boom.  ""I'm outraged that after receiving a huge windfall from the 2017 tax law, many companies chose to spend billions on stock buybacks instead of making long-term investments in their company and their workers,"" Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, told CNN Business in an email.   Wall Street loves buybacks because they pad per-share earnings, shrink share counts and provide a powerful source of demand for stocks. In fact, Corporate America was the biggest single buyer of stocks during the 11-year bull market that ended earlier this month.  Airlines spent $42.5 billion on buybacks The Big Four Airlines, according to Baldwin's office, spent $42.5 billion on buybacks between 2014 and 2019. That nearly matches $50 billion the industry is now asking for.   ""If they had instead made those long-term investments, they might be better positioned to handle the potential economic crisis that we're seeing because of the coronavirus,"" Baldwin said.  Baldwin, a longtime critic of buybacks, introduced legislation last week that would permanently ban buybacks at bailed-out companies that repurchased $1 billion of stock over the last five years.   Senator Elizabeth Warren has similarly called for a permanent ban on buybacks at bailed-out companies, along with restrictions on layoffs, dividends and CEO bonuses.  Indeed, the economic stimulus legislation being debated by Congress would restrict buybacks from companies that participate in the federal loan program unless they are granted a waiver by the Treasury Secretary. However, that restriction would remain in place only while the loan is outstanding.  President Donald Trump voiced firm support last week for preventing buybacks at bailed-out companies.  ""I am fine with restricting buybacks,"" Trump told reporters during a briefing on Friday. ""In fact, I would demand that there be no stock buybacks. I don't want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their stock, because that does nothing.""  'We thought they would have known better' But it was Trump's signature legislative accomplishment that set off an epic buyback boom on Wall Street.  Buybacks at S&P 500 companies exploded by 55% to a record $806.4 billion in 2018, the first year the tax law took effect, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. S&P 500 companies repurchased another $728.7 billion of stock in 2019.  Defenders of buybacks correctly note that this money doesn't just disappear. Shareholders can reinvest that money into startups or purchases that boost the economy. And buybacks can be a more productive use of money than companies just sitting on a pile of cash or wasting it on ill-conceived acquisitions.  Still, critics say buybacks amplify America's inequality divide because the rich own more of the stock market than the rest of the country. The top 10% of households owned 84% of all stocks in 2016, according to NYU professor Edward Wolff.   And buybacks don't create jobs, at least not directly the way building a factory does.   Trump seemed to acknowledge this problem, saying he doesn't ""like"" buybacks because they ""artificially"" boost stock prices and don't help workers.  ""When we did a big tax cut, and when they took the money and did buybacks, that's not building a hangar, that's not buying aircraft, that's not doing the kind of things that I want them to do,"" Trump said on Friday. ""We didn't think we would have had to restrict it because we thought they would have known better. But they didn't know better, in some cases.""  Buy (back) high, sell low Some on Wall Street have also been critical of the buybacks at companies that are now seeking bailouts.  ""The airline industry is in essence asking the government to buy the bought back shares at a 10% profit!!!"" billionaire investor Jeff Gundlach complained on Twitter last week.   ""I strongly suggest no government bailouts whatsoever. Stop back stopping greed and mismanagement,"" Gundlach said in a separate tweet.   To his point, some of these buybacks were done at what now look like incredibly inflated prices. (A bear market will do that to you). That raises further questions about the value of those buybacks, except of course to shareholders who exited at those prices.   Marriott International, the world's biggest hotel chain, announced last week it will start to furlough workers because of the crisis.   Yet Marriott spent $2.3 billion last year to repurchase 17.3 million shares. Marriott's buyback spree continued in 2020. At the end of February, the hotel giant executed $150 million of buybacks -- at an average price of $145.42. Marriott (MAR) is now trading at just $70, or less than half that level.   Rainy day funds The airline industry has defended its buybacks. Airlines for America, the industry trade group, said the companies spent about $48 billion on buybacks in the last 10 years. By comparison, the airlines say they spent far more -- $424 billion -- on employee wages and benefits. And they spent $139 billion to buy planes and make other investments.   Of course, it's terribly difficult for companies to plan for 80% crashes in revenue. Few saw the coronavirus storm coming -- until it was far too late.   ""This bailout has nothing to do with buying back stock and paying dividends,"" said Helane Becker, airline analyst with Cowen. ""You can argue they should have rainy day funds, but how big a fund are they supposed to have?""  In the future, airlines and other bailed-out companies won't have a choice. Buybacks won't even be an option. ",3/24/2020

There have been scattered reports of fights breaking out in wine and toilet paper aisles. ""This is a natural reaction to some of the panic and frenzy we have been seeing,"" said David Levenberg, president of Center Security Services, a retail security consulting firm. ""Supplies are limited and the more people think they need to hoard toilet paper, the more likely it is that things will get out of control.""   ""There needs to be some organization and a physical deterrent to aggressive behavior at these stores,"" Levenberg said. ShopRite, Stop & Shop and Kroger (KR) are three major chains beefing up their security, according to the companies. Kroger has increased its off-duty police and uniformed presence in Columbus, Ohio, said a spokesperson for the city police department. Walmart  (WMT)is using a mix of off-duty law enforcement and third-party security, a spokesperson said. ""The big difference is that everything is at a much broader scale because it's all happening nationally."" Some ShopRite stores are adding private security guards to help with crowd control or paying local police departments to direct traffic in crowded parking lots, according to a spokesperson. Stop & Shop is adjusting its security to cover early morning hours for customers over the age of 60 and shoppers with weakened immune systems.  ""Additional security guards have been added to a select number of stores that are seeing increased traffic,"" said Jennifer Brogan, a spokesperson for Stop & Shop. Some police departments around the country are stationing more cops in grocery stores as well. ""In addition to routine patrol, officers are also being directed to conduct additional patrols at schools, supermarkets, and hospitals to ensure the safety of everyone present at those locations,"" said a spokesperson for the New York Police Department. Clark County, Ohio, Sheriff Deborah Burchett said on Facebook that there will be a deputy officer posted at every grocery store in the county.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/perspectives/saudi-arabia-oil-market/index.html,Saudi Arabia just won control of the oil market ,"But even more importantly, this new policy recalibrated global oil markets, giving Saudi Arabia the long-term advantage. This move marks a big change for the world's largest oil exporter, which has in recent years attempted to manage the global oil markets by altering production levels, while garnering the difficult cooperation of Russia. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has finally decided to pursue a long-term policy that not only preserves and ultimately increases the kingdom's market share, but also may signal the end of OPEC as a united functioning organization. This decision is very unpopular with most oil exporting countries, international energy companies and American shale producers because collapsing prices will drastically decrease their revenues and, in some cases, force them into bankruptcy.  There are several reasons why the kingdom is finally taking this aggressive approach. First, the successive Saudi monarchs have all recognized the strategic importance of spare production capacity to manage the global markets because it provides the vital indicator of the world's oil market's ability to respond to sudden crises that jeopardize the free flow of oil supplies.  Saudi Aramco, the state's gargantuan oil and gas company, spent over $35 billion since 2012 to maintain a 12 million barrels-per-day sustained production capacity with a 1.5 to 2 million barrels-per-day spare capacity cushion that can be called upon at short notice. And that's exactly what the Saudis will be doing over the next several weeks. Saudi Aramco is expected to be pumping a staggering 12 million barrels per day by April 1, 2020, with exports reaching between 9.5 to 10 million barrels per day.  On April 1 or shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia will most likely surpass Russia to become the world's second largest producer. But this oil price war won't end until Saudi Arabia takes back the global production crown from the United States, which should happen within the next two years. No country other than Saudi Arabia, including Russia, has had the political and financial will to invest so heavily in upstream production capacity. This provides the Saudis with the means to go it alone and inflict insurmountable chaos on the vast majority of their conventional and shale oil producing competitors around the world. To emphasize this point, a new directive was issued last week by the kingdom's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, to increase Saudi Aramco's sustained production capacity to 13 million barrels per day in about 24 months.  From an internal Saudi perspective, lower oil prices are manageable for the next decade. According to Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, ""In a nutshell, Saudi Aramco can sustain the very low price and can sustain it for a long time."" Saudi oil is the cheapest to produce (gross taxes, capital spending, production and transportation costs) in the world at $8.98 per barrel, according to the Aramco IPO prospectus of last year. In comparison, US shale oil costs $23.35 per barrel (and $20.99 for non-shale), while Russian production costs average $19.21 per barrel, according to the Energy Information Administration. In fact, with new drilling technologies, Saudi production costs have decreased even further at some fields, such as at the world's largest offshore oil field, Shaybah. Second, the Saudis have over $500 billion in net foreign assets, so their public finances are shielded to a sudden drop in revenues from petroleum sales.  The new Saudi policy suggests that sustained lower prices will help them maintain, and with time, increase their market share in the face of the shale oil production boom in the US. Hydraulic fracturing for shale oil has already added several million new barrels of oil per day to the global market. However, shale oil is expensive to extract, so lower prices averaging between $20 to $25 per barrel for the US benchmark will mean several important US producers will find their business models unsustainable soon enough and completely insolvent over the long term.  Saudi Arabia holds about 25% of the world's oil reserves, about 70% of global spare production capacity, and it is the world's largest crude exporter by a large margin.  Through various revenue model projections based on different oil price averages and export levels, the Saudi finance ministry and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) are designing financial government expenditure plans that can sustain oil prices falling as low as $30 per barrel on average for at least the next five years, with temporary dips as low as $15 per barrel, according to various government financial projections. Aramco CFO Khalid Al Dabbagh re-emphasised this point by saying ""We [Aramco] are very comfortable we can meet our shareholders' expectations at $30 a barrel or even lower.""  It would be a grave mistake to doubt the political resolve of the current Saudi leadership to see this new policy through.  Saudi Arabia has created a new oil market with new fundamentals. Oil producers that have not understood this tectonic shift and have failed to adapt to this new reality will suffer and will be left behind.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/tech/funeral-livestreams-coronavirus/index.html,Funerals are the latest part of American life to move online,"Instead, they watched the burial via a livestream. But many either couldn't figure out how to use it or struggled to hear key parts of it.  Just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged funeral directors to move services online amid the coronavirus outbreak, families like the Galindos are grappling with an unthinkable new normal. ""Being a millennial on the internet, I've watched my fair share of livestreamed events, but it was sad for all the wrong reasons,"" her 27-year-old grandson Garrett Galindo told CNN Business. ""It was sad that my grandmother, a woman known for her love of large gatherings, parties and get-togethers, would have her final service be in front of only 10 of her loved ones. It was sad that even with today's technology it was so difficult to hear her eulogy, and it was sad knowing we couldn't share those final moments together as a family.""  Ahead of the service, St. Helens Roman Catholic Church in Phoenix, Arizona, informed the family that attendance should be kept to a minimum due to the outbreak. Isabel Galindo's three children and their spouses, along with three of her 11 grandchildren, went in person. Garrett's father used his iPhone on a tripod to broadcast the service online from his private Facebook account. ""There were about 20 or so people watching,"" said Garrett Gallindo, who tuned in on his laptop while working from home. ""My grandmother had more friends than one could count, but the vast majority of them aren't too internet or tech savvy. If they were, I would expect that number to be closer to 100."" The spread of the coronavirus has already canceled some of life's biggest moments, from delaying funerals to postponing weddings, graduations and baby showers. It's also forcing Americans to turn to livestreaming or video chat options for events central to our daily lives that would ordinarily revolve around in-person gatherings: school, office meetings, religious services and college tours. Funerals are just the latest, and potentially the most heartbreaking, example of this trend. With more than 7,000 deaths in the US each day, many don't want to delay celebrating the lives of loved ones.  In an effort to reduce crowds and promote ""social distancing,"" the CDC advised the National Funeral Directors Association in a webinar to encourage its network to livestream services and burials to help prevent the spread of the virus. As of Sunday, there were at least 32,149 confirmed cases in the US. ""For example, if live-streaming and limiting in-person attendance to immediate family is possible, we encourage that. Additionally, promoting social distancing at the event, regardless of size, and promoting hand hygiene as well is also important,"" David Berendes, an epidemiologist with the CDC, said during the briefing. Outside of the US, some countries, including the UK, have already embraced the trend. In China and Italy, funerals are temporarily banned until future notice and families have been advised to cremate the bodies of those who have died from the illness.  ""We have used our livestream for funerals a few times before the COVID-19 outbreak as a way to provide the service to family members who couldn't travel,"" said Pastor Bryan Sabourin of Holy Trinity Parish in Nova Scotia, Canada. ""We were talking about expanding this if we had enough people trained to use it and available for this ministry."" When one of his parishioners recently died, the church and the family decided to livestream the upcoming service on YouTube. ""I haven't received a single negative comment from parishioners about using livestream for this funeral,"" said Sabourin, who is currently in self-isolation after recently returning from out of the country. ""I won't be presiding at the funeral or even attending, which is sad as I knew the family well,"" he said ahead of the service. ""But my associate pastor will preside and pass on my deepest sympathies. I myself will be watching the livestream."" However, just as people have criticized livestreamed religious services in the past for being an unsatisfying replica of the in-person experience, some feel the same way about bringing funeral online. ""I'm glad to have seen some portion of [my grandmother's livestreamed funeral], but otherwise, I'm upset about the whole ordeal,"" said Garrett Gallindo. ""It's hard to feel a part of anything when you're sitting at home.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/media/fox-news-donald-trump-coronavirus-reliable-sources/index.html,Fox News hosts eye shutdown end as Trump says 'cure' can't be worse than 'problem' ,"President Trump and some of the biggest voices on Fox News started to aggressively push the same message on Monday: That the strict measures currently in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus cannot last indefinitely and should, perhaps, be eased after the 15-day shutdown period. ""We can't let the cure be worse than the problem,"" Trump said at the daily briefing, repeatedly hammering home that same message. At the briefing, Trump said he didn't want a medical problem to become an economic problem, seemingly disregarding the fact that the two are closely linked. The President added that decisions on how to tackle the pandemic should not solely be left to medical professionals. ""If it were up to the doctors, they may say, 'Let's shut down the entire world,'"" Trump said, adding, ""You know, we can't do that."" That line of thinking sounded awfully similar to what Fox personalities have started to argue. ""Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces — whipping up fear over this virus,"" Fox host Steve Hilton said Sunday. ""They can afford an indefinite shutdown. Working Americans can't, they'll be crushed by it."" On Monday morning, Laura Ingraham tweeted that doctors ""should not be the determinative voices in policy making now or at the end of 15 days."" And Larry Kudlow appeared on Fox to argue that ""the cure can't be worse than the disease."" Even Tucker Carlson, who has been one of the voices on Fox that has taken the coronavirus seriously, said, ""You can't just let epidemiologists run a country of more than 320 million people."" Carlson said it was ""vital"" to find a ""balance"" between fighting the virus and allowing the economy to function. Carlson later hosted Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick who suggested grandparents ""take a chance"" on their ""survival"" in ""exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren."" Patrick said, ""If that's the exchange, I'm all in."" Moore and Laffer also lobbying Over at WaPo, the newspaper reported Monday that Stephen Moore and Art Laffer— two Fox regulars — have also been ""lobbying the White House for more than a week to consider scaling back the recommendation that restaurants, stores and other gathering spots be closed."" Moore told WaPo, ""From my sources, the view in the White House is shifting toward getting the economy reopened."" There is some dissent Not everyone at Fox is on board with Trump's idea. Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino, who is often blunt in his assessments of the President, pushed back against the idea of ending the shutdown. Gasparino said ""the hospital systems"" can't likely ""take the flood of patients"" that will need to be admitted if those policies are lifted. ""They haven't been prepared because, essentially, central government was downplaying it for so long,"" Gasparino added. Hayes' point MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted Monday, ""I'm watching the 'just let the virus do it's thing and keep the economy humming' school of thought grow on the right. And it seems worth noting something crucial."" Hayes wrote, ""Just think of the economics of this: if you stopped lockdowns, and sent everyone back to work, lots and lots of people would get sick. You'd have workplaces where half the staff were out. And this would roll through all kinds of places, people who maintain the electrical grid and water treatment and sewage systems, etc."" ""Not only that, as the hospitals filled up and horror stories emerged, you'd have tons of deaths from things other than Covid-19 that couldn't get treated,"" Hayes added. ""This would make ppl more scared of getting the bug and lead to further retreat. Which is to say, even if you care about economic activity as the only value here, it's really not clear that anything like 'business as usual' is even a possibility in the midst of a roaring pandemic, even if you let everything stay open.""

CNN Business had an opportunity to try both. ""Animal Crossing"" trains its users in patience, as stores within the game close at night as they do in real life, and fish and insects sometimes resist capture. Its bright characters and peaceful vacation setting help provide a change of scenery, while still being somewhat realistic (you have to take out home loans to expand your real estate).  As more people begin to play the game, an online feature allows you to visit friends' islands, making it possible for players in real life to connect to each other. It could be a way for people to connect online during social distancing. In contrast, ""Doom Eternal"" throws you right into skull-smashing, guns-blazing action set to a rousing soundtrack, and hardly ever lets up. Being able to progress in ""Doom,"" especially at harder difficulty levels like ""ultra-violence"" and ""nightmare"" mode, is truly a test of skill. id Software's Doom packs a lot of nostalgia and has been around for 26 years. But Nintendo's 19-year-old ""Animal Crossing"" commands its own cult following and analysts predict ""New Horizons"" could outsell ""Doom Eternal."" Michael Pachter, an analyst at private financial services firm Wedbush, said he anticipated ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" could hit 10 million in lifetime sales, while ""Doom Eternal"" could potentially trail behind at 6 million. ""I think consumers will be thankful for something new to play given that so many find themselves cooped up under shelter in place regulations, so yes, I think that staying home will have a positive impact on sales,"" said Pachter. ""Doom"" shook up the video game industry when it first came out in 1993 as a free file for PCs that people could download. Future versions were sold in retail. ""Doom"" popularized the first-person shooter, a genre now dominated by ""Call of Duty"" games and ""Apex Legends."" James Landino, a video game music composer, told CNN Business his tweet was meant as entertainment. ""There's all different kinds of gamers,"" he said.  Personally, he is playing ""Animal Crossing"" and not ""Doom Eternal"" because he isn't a fan of shooters or horror, he said. ""I've been playing 'Doom' since my childhood and I'm very excited for 'Doom Eternal,'"" Autumn Walters, 22, who works in the medical industry in Alaska, told CNN Business. ""It has that awesome power fantasy to it which makes it so much fun.""  Walters said she would consider playing ""Animal Crossing"" but would buy ""Doom"" first as ""as I have been looking forward to it first."" ""I'm sure you've seen comments from fans of both games online — there's a shared sense of excitement among fans of both series,"" said Bill Trinen, senior director of product marketing at Nintendo. Retailers have also been impacted by the ongoing pandemic. GameStop notified customers that they could pick up their copy of Doom Eternal a day early on March 19 ""as a safety precaution for our customers and associates."" It said it would carry Animal Crossing on March 20 ""to further help separate the crowds."" Amazon said in a statement to CNN Business that it was temporarily prioritizing ""household staples, medical supplies and other high demand products coming into our fulfillment centers"" so customers who ordered Animal Crossing or Doom may experience a delay in delivery. ""As COVID-19 has spread, we've recently seen an increase in people shopping online which has had an impact on how we serve our customers,"" Amazon said. ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause our customers.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/perspectives/coronavirus-china-xi/index.html,The fallout from coronavirus will only make China's Xi Jinping more powerful ,"This may seem surprising given Xi's initial response to the Covid-19 outbreak. Xi disappeared from sight for more than a week just days after Beijing was forced to acknowledge the virus, spurring social media speculations and criticism of his aloofness. This reflected especially poorly on Xi because the ruling Chinese Communist Party has long predicated its legitimacy on effective governance, including delivering consistent economic growth and rising standards of living.  So why is Xi poised to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever? First, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be a key channel of post-outbreak stimulus. Xi has overseen a renaissance of the country's SOEs, forcing mergers to create national champions in key sectors, including rail, nuclear and renewable energy and building materials, among others. And with economic activity constrained by the measures taken to combat the coronavirus, SOEs will take on an even larger national role. They will likely receive much-needed financing, given their connections to state-owned banks. And Beijing is pushing for more infrastructure investment to support the economy, an area where SOEs play a prominent role.  Meanwhile, privately owned small and medium enterprises have been disproportionately impacted by the lockdowns that blanketed the entire country, as locally-owned shops and restaurants with thin cash margins and greater difficulties in restarting business activity face imminent bankruptcy. The result: a further shift in economic weight toward SOEs controlled by Beijing and focused on implementing Xi's policy priorities. Second, as the economy struggles to recover, officials will attempt to defuse social pressures by appealing to nationalist sentiment. Xi will point to the mishandled US response to the disease as both a reason for China's anemic economic performance, as well as a sign of the shortcomings of democratic capitalist systems. This line of messaging provides Beijing a way to channel social concern over the economic impact of the health crisis into a feeling of pride in the perceived advantages of a system in which he wields outsized power.  Third, despite leading the party's response, Xi has been able to deflect popular discontent regarding the initial outbreak toward lower-level officials, sparing himself and other elites. Beijing has dispatched inspection teams to uncover missteps made in the initial weeks of the outbreak, placing the blame elsewhere in the system.  The distinction between the mishandled initial response and the strength of the Xi-led response touted by state media will provide political cover for him to discipline anyone who spoke out about the failures in addressing the outbreak. In this, Xi will also be aided by his mixed messaging. He has pushed for both containing the disease and restarting work as equal priorities. As a result, he has shielded himself from criticism in case of a renewed outbreak or ongoing economic weakness. For Xi, the success in containing the outbreak so far justifies the aggressive quarantine efforts. But more broadly, it offers vindication for the political system that enabled the quarantine: a presidency with unchecked power over lower-level officials, the propaganda apparatus, and the levers of economic power. As China digs itself out from the weeks-long shutdown, Xi will use this success to expand the party's power over the economy, national dialogue and lower-level officials. He will be supported in doing so by the stumbling response in the US and will likely emerge in an even more powerful position, despite the political and economic weaknesses exposed by the initial outbreak in China.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/business/walmart-kroger-amazon-trader-joes-pay-bonuses/index.html,Bonuses and pay hikes: How grocery stores keep workers on the front lines,"The pay bumps, designed to retain and reward workers during the pandemic, are temporary. But industry critics hope they serve as a path forward toward improved pay for some of America's low-wage workers. Walmart (WMT) will pay special cash bonuses to its full- and part-time hourly workers totaling $550 million and raise wages for workers at its fulfillment centers by $2 an hour through Memorial Day. Amazon (AMZN) is temporarily boosting its minimum wage for hourly workers to $17 an hour, up from $15, and raising overtime pay for warehouse workers. Target (TGT) is also upping its minimum wage to $17 for hourly workers and paying out bonuses to 20,000 hourly store team leaders. On Monday, CVS (CVS) said it will give bonuses of up to $500 to hourly workers, store managers and pharmacists. Grocers, whose employees are now designated as emergency workers in several states, are taking similar steps. Albertsons, which also owns Safeway, is raising wages by $2 an hour, Kroger (KR) is giving full-time workers a $300 cash bonus and part-timers $150, and Trader Joe's is setting up a bonus pool for employees.  H-E-B in Texas and Whole Foods are also temporarily raising hourly pay. BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) said Monday that it will raise wages by $2 an hour for workers and give bonuses to managers. The last time so many companies announced pay hikes and showered employees with bonuses was after President Donald Trump signed corporate tax cuts into law in late 2017.   Now, grocers and retailers staying open through the crisis are trying to offer their vulnerable employees additional inducements to come into work and keep operations running smoothly. These companies are also hiring additional workers to keep up with demand and to give their regular employees a breather. ""These retail companies are trying to incentivize workers to come to work,"" said Patricia Campos-Medina, co-director of the New York State AFL-CIO/Cornell Union Leadership Institute at Cornell University's ILR School and a former SEIU official.  Campos-Medina predicts that pressure will rise on companies to make temporary wage hikes permanent.  ""The expectations have been set that these companies can pay a higher wage if they are forced to,"" she said. ""American workers will demand more from employers."" Despite the pay raises, some critics say Walmart, Amazon and other companies are not doing enough for their employees during the crisis. Walmart and Amazon have instituted emergency leave policies related to coronavirus. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote to the CEOs of the those companies and of McDonald's (MCD) Friday pressing them to expand their paid sick leave policies. ""I am encouraged that you have recognized the importance of paid sick leave during the current crisis by introducing emergency sick leave policies,"" Warren said. ""However, I am concerned that gaps in these policies will leave many workers without the option to follow best medical advice when they are sick, putting themselves, their colleagues, and their communities at greater risk.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/tech/ibm-supercomputing-coronavirus/index.html,IBM partners with White House to direct supercomputing power for coronavirus research,"IBM (IBM) partnered with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Energy to create the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium. The effort, which IBM started just last week, is expected to harness powerful high performance computing, or ""supercomputing,"" resources that will massively increase the speed and capacity of coronavirus-related research.  ""How can we find new treatments? Or ultimately vaccines and a cure?"" Director of IBM Research Dario Gil asked in an interview with CNN Business. ""Those are the areas we'll be looking at ... We're going to bring an unprecedented amount of computing power"" to address coronavirus.  The system will harness 16 supercomputing systems from IBM, national laboratories, several universities, Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others. Computing power will be provided via remote access to researchers whose projects are approved by the consortium's leadership board, which will be comprised of tech industry leaders and White House and Energy Department officials. The group plans to begin accepting research proposals through an online portal that will go live Sunday evening.   Supercomputers can solve calculations and run experiments that, if done on traditional computing systems or by hand, would take months or years. In traditional computing systems and data centers, each computer functions and does calculations independently. By contrast, high performance computers can work together and pass calculations between one another to process information more quickly. Such computers are also especially good for conducting research in areas like epidemiology and molecular modeling because the systems mirror the interconnectivity that exists in nature, Gil said. The consortium will also connect researchers with top computational scientists to ensure the machines are used as efficiently and effectively as possible. The services and computing power will be provided for free to researchers.  ""We're bringing together expertise ... even across competitors, to work on this,"" Gil said. ""We think it's important to bring a sense of community and to bring science and capability against this goal. These systems are some of the most in demand scientific and computational systems that we have."" Supercomputing systems, especially those at national laboratories, are used for critical work such as safeguarding the country's nuclear stockpile. The consortium, Gil said, will manage priorities for the system and ensure as much supercomputing power is allocated to coronavirus research as possible.  An early project by researchers at the University of Tennessee using IBM's Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has highlighted the potential for the technology.  Researchers used the supercomputer to screen 8,000 compounds to identify the 77 most likely to bind to the main ""spike"" protein in the coronavirus and render it incapable of attaching to host cells in the human body. Those 77 compounds can now be experimented on with the aim of developing a coronavirus treatment. The supercomputer, Gil said, made it possible to avoid the lengthy process of experimenting on all 8,000 of those compounds. ""America is coming together to fight COVID-19, and that means unleashing the full capacity of our world-class supercomputers to rapidly advance scientific research for treatments and a vaccine,"" Michael Kratsios, Chief Technology Officer for the United States, said in an emailed statement. ""We thank the private sector and academic leaders who are joining the federal government as part of the Trump Administration's whole-of-America response.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/perspectives/anthony-scaramucci-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html,Scaramucci: Americans need a lot more from the US government and they need it now,"The world is at war with an invisible enemy, and we need a wartime-like public health and economic response if we hope to prevail. The Federal Reserve has done all it can by moving interest rates back to zero and announcing open-ended quantitative easing, but, as we've seen in Europe and Japan, all the liquidity in the world doesn't mean a thing if aggregate demand dries up. Goldman Sachs now projects Q2 GDP to fall as much as 24%.  The Treasury Department last week unveiled a $1 trillion stimulus proposal that includes small business loans and targeted industry bailouts. That is not nearly enough, nor is it the right approach.  Based on deficit levels the US government took on during World War II, we believe we have room to enact $3.2 trillion in fiscal stimulus — more than triple the current Treasury proposal.  I would take three key steps as part of a historic $3.2 trillion stimulus to combat economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic: Send people money The federal government should, as soon as possible, send $3,000 to every adult and $1,500 to every child to cover basic living expenses for the next three months. The estimated total cost would be around $900 billion.  Backstop jobs The federal government should become the ""buyer of last resort"" for all industries suffering as a result of unprecedented social distancing guidelines, a solution mooted by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.  The government would fill in revenue shortfalls across all industries, rather than conduct selective bailouts, with the requirement that companies receiving aid agree not to lay off any workers and to suspend dividends for three years and share buybacks indefinitely. For contract workers, the program would act like unemployment insurance. Universal paid sick leave would be guaranteed by the federal government. Interest-free credit lines would be made available to address short-term liquidity issues.  This is the most straightforward way to avoid mass job losses, prevent huge holes from forming in state fiscal budgets and allow companies to quickly resume the normal course of business when the virus abates.  Cut taxes The Treasury has already pushed back Tax Day until July 15, but it should take a step further and eliminate federal income taxes this year for the bottom 75% of the population, or households making less than $85,000. The government should also suspend all mortgage, rent, student loan and tax payments for up to 90 days.  These economic measures should be taken in concert with an expanded federal public health response, including a 30-day nationwide shutdown to flatten the curve of infection, free drive-thru coronavirus testing centers, temporary hospital facilities and the federal purchase or manufacture of respirators and ventilators for all those who need them.  The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the fragility and stratification of both our American health care and socioeconomic systems. Nearly 75% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck without emergency savings or the means to cover costs from an unexpected health issue. For the wealthiest country in the world, that is unacceptable. When the current crisis subsides, we need to address these issues with a more progressive and efficient tax code, smarter social safety nets that confront modern realities and expanded health care coverage for low-income Americans.  The economic recovery from the global financial crisis was slow by historical standards due to the fact we undershot the size of fiscal stimulus in 2009. Let's not make the same mistake again. With the right solutions, we can come through this crisis stronger and more united than we entered it.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/business/bangalore-traffic-tech-biz-intl/index.html,How India's Silicon Valley is using tech to tackle traffic,"The city has the worst congestion in the world, according to the 2019 TomTom Traffic Index, overtaking Mumbai, which held the title for the previous two years. Bangalore's rapid expansion as India's tech capital is partly responsible. The number of cars on the roads has rocketed from 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million in 2019.  But tech could also provide the solution, as startups have sprung up to break the gridlock.  Take Bounce, a Bangalore-based scooter-hire company with a fleet of more than 17,000 electric and gasoline vehicles in its home city. Customers can rent a scooter via its app for as little as 14 rupees (19 cents) an hour.  Founded in 2014, Bounce now operates in more than 30 cities in India with both a docked and dockless model, where you can pick up or drop off the bike anywhere in the city. It claims more than 120,000 rides are taken on its scooters in Bangalore every day.  In January, the startup received a fresh $105 million in funding, taking its overall capital to more than $200 million, Varun Agni, its CTO and co-founder, tells CNN Business. This led to its latest public valuation of $500 million, he adds. While the initial motivation behind Bounce was ""democratizing the commute"" and providing affordable access to mobility for all, one major byproduct has been a reduction in traffic, says Agni.  Four in 10 users start or end at a subway station, he says. ""This has a massive impact on reducing traffic and congestion,"" as it encourages people to use public transport rather than using a car for the whole trip, he adds. It also has an impact on the environment, especially as the company introduces more electric scooters to its fleet; by the end of the year, at least half of its vehicles will be electric, says Agni. Cutting cars and carbon emissions Transportation is the biggest source of harmful emissions in Bangalore, according to air quality research group Urban Emissions Info.   Quick Ride, a carpooling company also founded in Bangalore, aims to create a sustainable commuting option while cutting the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions, the company tells CNN Business.  It estimates it has saved 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions since its founding in 2015, equivalent to that emitted by 19,000 passenger vehicles in one year.  Using its app, drivers connect with passengers on the same route and fill their empty car seats. Quick Ride's system allows them to share the cost of the journey using fixed per-kilometer charges and it manages the payments through user accounts, removing the need for cash exchanges.  It operates in nine cities across India with a total of 3.5 million users, almost a third of which are based in Bangalore. The company says it has raised a total of $15.5 million in funding.   Companies including consulting firm Capgemini (CAPMF) have partnered with Quick Ride to encourage employees to carpool, as part of their corporate sustainability strategy.  More than 70% of employees signed up to Capgemini's  #CAReToShare campaign in 2019, and since the start of the program in 2017 they have clocked up more than 33 million kilometers in carpool journeys, the company says.  ""This program was launched with the dual objective of making the daily commute for our employees more convenient, while trying to ease the pollution plaguing our cities,"" Vijay Chandramohan, senior director of India's corporate real estate services for Capgemini, tells CNN Business. ""Cities in India are growing at an exponential rate,"" he says. ""There is tremendous pressure on the city roads, leading to increasing traffic snarls and commute time resulting in frustration and loss of productivity.""

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, argued Monday that the American people ""don't want another corporate bailout"" that prioritizes Wall Street and airlines over workers. ""The fact is, we need to learn from 10 years ago,"" he said. ""The same people came to us and said, 'We need this bailout.' They promised that it would help people stay in their homes. They promised that it would be money in the pockets of workers. The banks have done well. The executives have done well. But since then wages have basically remained flat."" CNN's Alex Rogers and Phil Mattingly report from Washington: Democratic senators have maintained that their response cannot reflect the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bank bailout often referred to as TARP, underscoring that the policy and political repercussions from that vote are still having ripple effects to this day. The policy fallout is plain — while the emergency efforts saved the financial system and, by extension, the economy, a similar scale of effort and aid wasn't made available to average Americans, at least not without onerous rules and regulations to overcome and strings attached. ""In our desire to overwhelmingly respond ... there were great mistakes made,"" Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said Sunday. ""We need to not only have a sense of urgency, we need to get it right."" One problem for Washington is that investors do have a sense of urgency when it comes to the stimulus package. Optimism that progress was being made contributed to a global stocks rally on Tuesday, but further signs of delay could spark a quick reversal and add to the collapse in stock prices. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, described the scale of Monday's intervention by the US Federal Reserve as ""incredible."" But lawmakers still need to pass that stimulus package. And on the comparison to 2008? ""The key [in 2008] was to limit the damage a financial crisis caused to the rest of the economy. The key now is to make sure that people can withstand the economic hardship caused by the collapse in activity, and that when the virus is beaten, the economy can recover as fast as possible,"" Juckes said. What can the world learn from China? The country where the pandemic began was almost completely shut down in late January as the number of coronavirus cases mounted. Now, with the outbreak apparently under control, China is trying to re-start its economy. Beijing's plan rests on a slew of policies and campaigns meant to push people back to work, encourage business confidence at home and abroad, and protect as many companies from failing as possible. Many parts of the country are lifting their lockdowns, removing road blockades and allowing people to travel more freely — as long as they have documented proof that they are healthy. But as my colleague Laura He reports from Hong Kong, Beijing has acknowledged that its attempt to get back to normal is risky. Some businesses have rushed back to work, only to be forced to shut down again when workers became infected. Analysts caution that the return of millions of people to work in China could also risk another outbreak if the virus hasn't been totally eradicated in local communities. ""In our view, the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 in China is rising,"" wrote Ting Lu, chief China economist for Nomura, in a recent report. Western governments are also debating when to lift restrictions on travel and public life. But China's blueprint might only provide so much help, particularly for economies that operate under less centralized government control.  ""The challenge in the West will be to incentivize people to go out to restaurants, theaters, and sporting events, rather than to get workers back to the factories,"" said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California at San Diego. ""The challenge is very different."" Meanwhile, there are signs that President Donald Trump is leaning toward re-starting the US economy weeks before the virus may peak.  ""Our country was not built to be shut down,"" the president said on Monday. ""We are going to be opening up our country for business because our country was meant to be open."" Europe is hurting Experts have been warning that economic data is going to take a dramatic turn for the worse in the coming weeks, revealing the scale of damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  One of the first reports out of Europe is ... not great.  IHS Markit's Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Index dropped to 31.4 in March from 51.6 in February, revealing what the survey's publishers described as the ""largest collapse in business activity ever recorded.""  The prior low for the eurozone was seen in February 2009, when the index hit 36.2. That suggests the pain is even more intense than during the peak of the global financial crisis. Huge job cuts are already underway. ""Employment is already falling at a rate not seen since July 2009 as despair about the outlook broadens, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Here's the reaction from Capital Economics: ""March's slump in the eurozone Composite PMI is so sharp that at any other time it would look like a spreadsheet error. But now it is all too believable, and April's data could be even worse,"" the research firm said. Reminder: US initial jobless claims will be published on Thursday.

Souder estimates at the rate of loss at his restaurant, it will lose $250,000 a quarter, which forced him to lay off 75 employees in one day. Souder's restaurant is a microcosm of the coronavirus' ravaging of an industry and a sign of what awaits other sectors of the US economy.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/perspectives/cash-payments-economic-disaster/index.html,Giving all US adults cash could help stop a depression,"There have been cancellations of everything from conferences to concerts. Restaurants, bars, malls and movie theaters all have fewer customers as people stay away from crowded spaces. With demand for goods and services dropping, workers are seeing their hours reduced, or they are getting laid off entirely. If those workers have sufficient savings, they might be able to weather the storm without dramatically reducing their own spending and spreading the economic damage further. But unfortunately, millions of households don't have even $400 in savings to draw on in an emergency like this. Those households will now have to struggle even more to pay rent or keep the lights on which, in turn, means even fewer customers for a wider array of businesses. The vicious cycle of recession has begun. This is where the federal government must step in. It's probably too late to stop a recession, but it's not too late to stop a depression. One idea that has gained a lot of support recently is having the federal government send cash directly to most — or even all — households. A fast, large infusion of money can be a bridge for families who have been impacted by the downturn and can keep the cycle from spiraling too far. With more cash in their pockets, workers who just lost their jobs will still be able to make their mortgage payments, put food on the table and get their cars fixed. Without that cash, not only will workers suffer terribly, but the businesses in the community that rely on their patronage will suffer too.  There are some objections to the idea of sending out cash, however. One concern is how to balance the need to get this cash out fast while also ensuring it goes to those who most need it and who are most likely to spend it, which will help reverse the vicious cycle of recession. Ideally, we wouldn't send checks to millionaires and the owners of giant corporations. An extra bump in their bank account isn't going to help the broader economy. But time is also of the essence. It's possible that adding conditions may make it take longer for the government to process the aid. But if it doesn't slow down delivery of the assistance, we should exclude the rich.  A second concern is that direct cash assistance will not be as effective in this downturn as it would be in others because so many people are deliberately reducing their demand for goods and services as they self-quarantine and try to reduce the spread of the virus. This is a legitimate worry and it's likely that direct cash assistance won't have as big of an impact right away. But for the millions of workers who have already lost income or are about to lose income in the coming weeks, they will spend this money immediately on necessities like groceries and rent. And for everyone else, a little extra will help the economy bounce back faster once we can leave our homes again. But while direct cash payments should be a key component of relief measures, it is far from a standalone solution. This crisis has laid bare the weaknesses of our public health infrastructure, labor protections and social safety net. Imagine if we'd already had a robust, national paid leave system in place before this virus arrived. Imagine if all food service workers had the ability to earn and use paid sick time. Imagine if workers could rely on strong, well-funded unemployment insurance. Imagine if more people were earning enough income during the good times to put some savings away for the bad times. Imagine if income inequality weren't already sapping consumer demand and weakening our ability to withstand temporary setbacks. Imagine a federal budget that invested in public health and disease prevention. In that world, the coronavirus might not have pushed us to the brink of an economic disaster. The coronavirus outbreak and its economic fallout are going to be, and already are, far worse and more painful than they had to be. Emergency cash payments to nearly all households as soon as possible can help prevent more suffering and boost the economy at the same time. It should be the next step, but it definitely cannot be the last one.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/success/mortgage-rate-fed-cut/index.html,What will a 0% interest rate mean for mortgages?,"This is the second emergency rate cut in two weeks, and brings the federal funds rate to between 0% and 0.25%. It's designed to stimulate the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money for a mortgage, among other things. Together with the Fed's move to buy at least $500 billion in US Treasuries and at least $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, the actions signal that the Fed puts the economic effect of the coronavirus outbreak on a similar level as the global financial crisis in 2008. Here's how it impacts mortgage rates. Will mortgage rates go to zero?  No, mortgage interest rates will probably not go to zero percent.  The federal funds rate is the rate banks pay to borrow money overnight.  ""Even the government can't borrow at zero percent,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""The most creditworthy consumer carries a higher risk than the US Treasury, so you are going to pay at least a couple percentage points more than that."" But mortgage rates are at historic lows and because of that there is increasing demand to take advantage. Should I rush to refinance or get a mortgage? There is no urgency right now, says McBride, because mortgage companies are inundated with applications.  ""There is literally a traffic jam to get on to the mortgage refinance highway,"" he said. ""You're not finding those low rates on a prevalent basis because they are marking up rates to give them a chance to work though the initial wave of demand.""  There are many things at play in the economy right now, but the conditions are set for mortgage rates to stay low for the balance of 2020, he said.  ""Once lenders ease the backlog of applications, rates should normalize and that will make for an opportune time to get in.""  What does this mean for the housing market? After dropping to historic lows, the 30-year fixed interest rate ticked up slightly last week. Now rates are expected to drop again, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com.  ""Lower rates may entice home buyers out to shop,"" said Hale.  Some people may feel the need to buy or refinance now so they don't miss out. That is keeping demand strong further into the future, she said.  The Fed is acting, Hale said, because the path ahead for the economy is uncertain. That could hurt the housing market both directly and indirectly. ""If buyers are hesitant to go shopping because they want to avoid contact with others, this could dampen home sales directly,"" she said.  ""As social distancing is practiced by more people for longer periods of time, a slowdown in consumer spending could eventually lead to job loss and lower incomes.""  Monetary policy is not a quick-acting tool, said Hale. ""It will be some time before we know whether this action was sufficient to sustain economic growth, but it's a large and coordinated move that will put households, the housing market, businesses, and the financial sector on better footing.""",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/business/retailers-nike-store-closures-coronavirus/index.html,"Nike, Urban Outfitters and other retailers shuttering stores temporarily because of coronavirus","Nike (NKE), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and more have announced that they are shuttering many or all of their retail stores around the globe through late March because of coronavirus. They followed makeup brand Glossier and outdoor brand Patagonia, which on Thursday and Friday were among the first consumer goods retailers to announce temporary store closures.  The companies all stressed that their online stores would remain open, though some, including Patagonia, have said shipments could be delayed as employees work remotely. Apple (AAPL) last month closed retail locations in China during the peak of the outbreak there. On Friday, the company said that while its China locations had reopened, it was closing stores in all other areas of the world.  President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus on Friday. As of Saturday, nearly 3,000 coronavirus cases had been reported in the United States, while more than 152,000 cases have been reported globally. Health experts have encouraged people to respond by practicing ""social distancing,"" which includes avoiding large gatherings and maintaining a physical distance of about six feet from other people.  ""What we've learned together (in China) has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response,"" Apple said in a statement Friday. ""One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus's transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we're taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers."" Many retailers have also closed offices and asked employees who work in other parts of the business to work from home.   Some of the largest grocery chains in the United States -— including Kroger (KR), Publix and Walmart (WMT) — have also announced reduced store hours in response to the outbreak. Similarly, Starbucks (SBUX) said Sunday it is moving to a ""to-go"" model, pausing all in-store seating and encouraging the use of its app to order ahead, at most company owned stores in the United States and Canada for at least two weeks.  What will the closures mean?  Retailers' sales are likely to take a hit from the closures.  Nike, for example, has more than 1,100 branded stores globally and nearly all of the company's growth last year came from direct to consumer sales at its Nike retail stores, factory outlets and Nike.com, according to NPD analyst Matt Powell. Powell said that while ""some of the closed store sales could be realized in Nike's wholesale partners and on Nike.com,"" Nike will likely ""see a negative sales impact from these closures."" But while retailers may suffer financially in the short term, the closures are a smart long term business decision, said Susquehanna International Group senior analyst Sam Poser.  ""It's an unfortunate but very necessary decision,"" Poser said.  ""How important are a few days of business versus the health of your people, the health of your employees and customers, and your brand reputation? ... You want to be around and strong, with your people and your customers, when the dust settles."" The situation is similar for Apple, which had already been feeling the negative impact of stores in China that closed last month and only just reopened, as well as supply chain issues caused by the outbreak in China.  ""At this point, the March quarter is going to be an iPhone (sales) number that's as doomsday as you could imagine ... At this point, investors have accepted that the March quarter is really a write off,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. However, Ives said, as a ""global brand"" and ""business leader,"" it is essential for Apple to prioritize the health of its employees and customers above short term profits. And the 5G iPhone on the horizon should help the company bounce back in the coming year.  Retailers with a smaller brick-and-mortar footprint, like Everlane, have also closed physical stores until late March. Here's a roundup of some of the larger brands. Retailers that have announced store closures:  Glossier:  All stores closed as of March 12, for at least the next two weeks. Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay for the two week scheduled closure. The company has also delayed the opening of its new Arizona store, which was scheduled for this upcoming Wednesday.  Patagonia:  All stores closed as of March 13. The company said it will reassess the situation and post an update on March 27. Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.

Corporate employees at Lush's headquarters in North America are also being asked to work from home if their jobs allow through the end of the month. Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay.The company said it will also be forced to ""significantly scale down our manufacturing and distribution operations"" for the duration of the store closures. Starbucks:  Instituting a ""to-go"" model in most company owned stores in the United States and Canada for at least two weeks. That means cafe and patio seating areas will be closed, though customers can still order at the counter, through the app and via the drive through. Stores will have modified condiment bars.Some stores in busy areas, such as university campuses, will be closed, and stores in areas with high concentrations of coronavirus cases will be closed or have reduced hours.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/retail-stores-coronavirus-macys-nordstrom/index.html,Retailers were struggling. Then came the coronavirus,"A wave of brands, including Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Nike (NKE), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), H&M and Victoria's Secret have announced in recent days that they will shut stores temporarily as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. Others, such as Kohl's (KSS), JCPenney (JCP) and Gap (GPS) are reducing store hours, but industry analysts expect they may soon follow their rivals as the coronavirus ripples across the country. Many of these chains have been grappling with a series of powerful forces chipping away at their businesses — Amazon (AMZN) and big-box retailers like Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), which are currently seeing a crush of demand; trendy upstart brands online; and discount players such as TJ Maxx (TJX).  Last year, more than 9,300 stores closed their doors, a 59% jump from the previous year. The retail sector lost upward of 75,000 jobs in 2019. Now, the industry is contending with the coronavirus and a likely recession that will sap consumer confidence. Foot traffic to US retail stores decreased 30.7% for the week ending on Friday compared with last year, according to the most recent data from Cowen. ""A challenging environment just got even more so,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeremy Metz. ""Many retailers are already stressed and hanging on by a thread.""  Although stores are closed temporarily and retailers have pledged to pay their workers in the coming weeks, companies may wind up shutting storefronts for good and laying off employees if the pandemic extends for months.  Deborah Weinswig, chief executive of retail research firm Coresight Research, expects to see more than 15,000 stores go out of business this year.  Brick-and-mortar clothing and department stores face the toughest challenges, analysts say.  ""Mall-based businesses are most at risk, especially those that have no momentum"" like Victoria's Secret  or companies that ""sell products that don't translate well online like candles,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a research note Monday. Department stores have been shrinking for years and former leaders of the sector like Sears and Bon-Ton have filed for bankruptcy. ""Department stores are extremely vulnerable in this environment,"" Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""The group has been struggling for years to find a winning formula and stem the loss of market share to Amazon, TJX, Ross Stores, and others."" Malls also face heightened risks. Store closings and bankruptcies in retail have led to vacant storefronts and so-called zombie malls around the country. Credit Suisse has predicted that one in four malls will close by 2022. ""The going thinking was already that a few hundred malls would die or go away,"" said Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Coronavirus may accelerate that process and put a damper on even healthier malls.",3/21/2020

Disney (DIS) also announced that it would be delaying ""The Personal History of David Copperfield,"" which was set to open on May 8, and ""The Woman in the Window,"" which was scheduled to hit theaters on May 15. The company did not say when it would release those films. The delay of ""Black Widow"" is newsworthy, but it's not surprising.  The coronavirus outbreak has decimated the move theater industry. Blockbuster films such as ""No Time to Die,"" ""F9"" and Disney's own ""Mulan"" have all been pushed back and the virus has caused major theater chains like AMC (AMC) and Regal (RBC) to close theaters nationwide.  ""Black Widow"" was the latest film in Marvel Studios' cinematic universe, and was set to open the summer movie season, arguably Hollywood's most lucrative time. Disney's superhero studios is one of the most popular box office brands in Hollywood history.  Marvel Studios' films have made more than $22 billion worldwide, according to Comscore (SCOR).

Companies that could, directed their employees to work from home. But for some employees and businesses, remote working is simply not an option. And the companies that have kept their doors open are getting little foot traffic as customers practice social distancing. Workers are wondering if they should do the same.  One thing has quickly become clear: Grappling with the outbreak will involve tough choices, especially for workers and small business owners.  ""A pandemic doesn't come up in your plan at all,"" said Matt Cross, a musician and owner of the Broad Street Public House in San Luis Obispo, California.  Kelly Their, owner of the Mia Wagner Salon in Manhattan, said her staff has urged her to let them to make house calls so they can continue earning money, but she worries about their health and the health of her customers. ""Do I have my staff sign waivers that they're willing to work during this time?"" Their said. ""Do I make the decision as a mother, so to speak, and say, 'No, I'm sorry, your safety is more important?'

Evon Dior Michelle works full time as a drag queen in Baltimore, Maryland hosting drag bingo and brunch events. It's been a year since Michelle quit a full-time job with benefits to pursue drag, but with every event this month canceled because of coronavirus and the future looking uncertain, Michelle has had to consider finding a different kind of work.  ""The thought of me spending this past year just really working so hard to build this life for myself ...  in a matter of 24 hours, it was all just swept away,"" Michelle said. ""It's how I pay my bills, it's how I'm able to help my family members ... So it's definitely going to be an interesting few months ahead of us."" Ed Chan enjoyed the flexibility of being a gig worker — working with a catering company making school lunches by day, and in guest services at a New York sports stadium by night. Suddenly, he was without any work as the schools and event venues shut down.  Chan is now trying to decide whether he can file for unemployment, given that he is an employee with multiple jobs and an irregular schedule.  ""I'm still sort of trying to figure out what ultimately the damage will be,"" Chan said. ""This could be major to me.""  Many people are starting to calculate how long their savings can keep them afloat. Others are brainstorming digital ""side hustles"" to bring in additional income.  Michelle plans to offer makeup lessons over FaceTime or Skype.  On St. Patrick's Day, Cross, the pub owner, played in a live-streamed concert with other musicians. He asked the virtual audience members to Venmo tips to help support them while gigs are canceled. Cross shut down his pub before California ordered bars to close and issued shelter-in-place orders in parts of the state earlier this week.  ""The community is seeing what we're doing to try to serve them, so I feel like when our doors do open back up, we will have won a lot of people over,"" he said. ""They're seeing that I'm not doing this to make the pub any money, I'm doing this to make the musicians money.""  Efforts are underway to make government aid available to workers and businesses. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to support paid sick leave for workers and federal lawmakers will consider a $1 trillion relief package that could provide checks for some American workers and families.  The Small Business Administration has also announced it will provide disaster relief loans for small businesses affected by coronavirus.

Toward the end of the exchange, Alexander cited the latest pandemic statistics showing thousands of Americans are now infected and millions are scared.  Alexander asked, ""What do you say to Americans who are scared?""  Trump, shaking his head, ripped into Alexander in response. ""I say that you are a terrible reporter,"" Trump replied. ""That's what I say.""  The President proceeded to launch into an extended rant against Alexander, saying he asked a ""nasty question"" and assailing NBC and its parent company, Comcast.  ""You're doing sensationalism,"" Trump charged. ""And the same with NBC and Comcast. I don't call it Comcast. I call it 'Con-Cast.'""  ""Let me just tell you something,"" Trump added. ""That's really bad reporting. And you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism."" Moments later, Kaitlan Collins, a White House correspondent for CNN, asked Trump if it was appropriate to embark on tirades against members of the news media during a public health crisis. ""You see yourself as a wartime President right now, leading the country through a pandemic that we are experiencing,"" Collins noted. ""Do you think going off on Peter, going off on a network is appropriate when the country is going through something like this?""  Trump defended his verbal assault on Alexander, saying he's ""not a good journalist"" and launching into another rant against him. ""Coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists,"" Trump said. Alexander said in a statement that he was ""trying to provide the president an opportunity to reassure the millions of Americans, members of my own family and my neighbors and my community and plenty of people sitting at home, this was his opportunity to do that, to provide a positive or uplifting message. Instead, you saw the president's answer to that question right now."" ""The bottom line is, this is a president whose experiences in life are very different than most Americans across this country right now,"" Alexander said. ""Not a person who likely worries about finances or had, not a person who in the course of his life is worried about his future, not a person who is worried about where to find a paycheck for his bills or for his rent and as evidenced by the president suggesting that an opportunity to provide for American some reassurance about how they should feel right now, the president instead took it out on me."" Chuck Todd, Alexander's NBC News colleague and host of ""Meet the Press,"" weighed on the matter, praising him for his ""professionalism."" ""I wish people on the on the other side of the podium had the same professionalism as well, so thank you, Peter,"" Todd said.       After striking a somber tone earlier in the week, Trump in recent days has returned to his usual attacks against the press.  At Thursday's coronavirus press briefing, Trump smeared The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. ""They're very dishonest,"" Trump claimed.  Trump then praised a far-right media outlet, saying it is ""very good"" and noting, ""They treat me very nicely.""  The right-wing personality from that media outlet falsely said major newsrooms had ""teamed up"" with the Chinese Communist Party to attack Trump. The person then asked, ""Is it alarming that major media players that just oppose you are consistently siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic radicals and Latin gangs and cartels?"" Instead of rebuking the right-wing personality for the question, Trump on Thursday boasted that he had canceled the White House's subscriptions to the country's major newspapers. ""It amazes me when I read the things that I read,"" Trump said Thursday. ""It amazes me when I read The Wall Street Journal which is so negative and The New York Times, I barely read it. We don't distribute it in the White House, and the same with The Washington Post.""",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/cars/truck-stops-coronavirus/index.html,"Right now, truck stops are some of America's most 'essential businesses'","Undeterred by the coronavirus pandemic that has brought most of the US economy to a halt, truck stops remain open, offering truckers a place to eat, rest and refuel on their way to delivering critical supplies to a nation that's hunkering down to slow the spread of COVID-19. Earlier this week, the US Department of Transportation said truck stops now qualify as an essential business, meaning they are viewed as too vital to shut down. ""In the coming weeks and months, it will be critical that these businesses remain open 24 hours a day,"" Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the government agency that regulates the nation's trucking industry, wrote in a letter to the National Association of Truck Stop Operators. Keeping truck stops open is especially important as a growing number of truckers work longer hours. Earlier this week, the federal government eased restrictions on the number of hours drivers transporting critical supplies, such as medical equipment, food, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants, are allowed to work.  While long-haul truck drivers spend a lot of time in isolation, they are still vulnerable to coronavirus. ""They're socially isolated 95% of the time, but that other 5% literally everyone is touching the exact same bathrooms and fuel pumps. That's a huge concern,"" said Steve Viscelli, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies the trucking industry. In order to keep drivers and employees healthy, many truck stops have put new policies in place. At some stops, drivers can no longer get their personal mugs filled with coffee, for instance, and must use new disposable cups instead. Lounges where drivers typically gather to watch TV and talk are generally being closed, as are sit-down restaurants. Instead, takeout and meals that can be quickly purchased are being offered. Cleaning regimens are also being conducted more frequently and thoroughly. Pilot Flying J, which operates truck stops in 44 states and six Canadian provinces, said its team has been cleaning showers after each use with degreaser, disinfectant and floor cleaner.  It's also restricting gaming rooms to three participants at a time, and has stopped providing any self-serve food. Employees showing any symptoms of illness are required to stay home. The company also implemented an emergency sick leave policy so that workers do not need to worry about being paid as they recover. ""It makes sense that there will need to be some changes in rest and truck stop operations,"" said Stephen Burks, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota, Morris, who spent a decade driving tractor trailers before becoming an academic. ""But keeping them available to truck drivers is just as important as any other function needed to enable an effective national response to the epidemic."" It does help that, with Americans avoiding unnecessary travel, there are fewer drivers on the road and at the truck stops.  Jon Pertchik, CEO of Travel Centers of America, which operates more than 260 locations in the US and Canada, said there's been a drop in gasoline sales this week due to decreased car traffic. But diesel sales are up, he said, likely from increased demand from truck drivers making deliveries during the pandemic.  Pertchik said he makes a point of reminding his staff how important they are in keeping the country running.  ""There's a patriotic obligation,"" he said. ""This company is carrying on and supporting essential needs to truckers who, in turn, provide essentials to Americans.""",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/media/streaming-coronavirus-disney/index.html,Will movies delayed by coronavirus shift to streaming? Not so fast,"Facing grim prospects, upcoming releases including Disney's ""Mulan"" and ""The New Mutants,"" Sony's James Bond film ""No Time to Die,"" Paramount's ""A Quiet Place"" sequel and Universal's latest Fast & Furious adventure ""F9"" have all been delayed.  But though many of those companies are hungry for product to propel streaming ventures, economic considerations suggest that these new movies -- or at least most of them -- won't be it. Because these blockbusters — especially a period piece like ""Mulan"" — don't have an expiration date, there's no reason to rush them to market.  While there could be some opportunity for mid-sized films to migrate to streaming, showcasing a potential smash like that live-action adaptation of the animated hit on Disney+ could be leaving a whole lot of money on the table. On Friday, Disney did announce that it would move up the availability of ""Frozen 2"" on Disney+ to March 15, offering it early to help families through ""these challenging times,"" the company said. But that follows a successful theatrical release that has seen the film earn $1.4 billion worldwide. ""A movie like 'Mulan' has a big budget, and it's been marketed already as a theatrical film. It's not so easy to just put it on Disney+,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. ""A major release like that costs Disney hundreds of millions of dollars and the financial lifespan of a production of that size needs to have some sort of theatrical release to make its money back.""  By contrast Netflix (NFLX), the premier streaming service, has experimented with some bigger-budget action movies debuting on its platform. They include ""Bright"" (starring Will Smith, with a reported $90-million budget) and the Ryan Reynolds vehicle ""6 Underground,"" directed by Michael Bay. The service has picked up a few more expensive films that were essentially dumped onto it, such as ""The Cloverfield Paradox."" Netflix also sunk a vast sum into Martin Scorsese's Oscar-nominated ""The Irishman,"" which nevertheless enjoyed a theatrical window before hitting the streaming world. The math is somewhat different, however, for Disney (DIS). Though the company has faced some second-guessing about its volume of originals on Disney+, despite the success of titles like ""The Mandalorian,"" Disney has said it remains very much committed to the theatrical experience.  That's in part because the major studios still want to wring profits out of their movies across multiple exhibition platforms — including the overseas and domestic box office — before getting another bite at the apple, as Snow White might say, by using them to stock their streaming shelves. However, Disney's media empire has been crippled because of the coronavirus outbreak. Its theme parks are closed, its cruise line is suspended and one of its biggest films of the year has been delayed. Major sporting events, the life's blood of Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended. Disney+ is now the focus of the Walt Disney Company. One exception to the theatrical-release-first rule could be a movie like ""The New Mutants,"" a spinoff of the X-Men franchise that Disney inherited when it acquired 20th Century Fox's entertainment assets. Seen as a troubled project which had been delayed multiple times before being pushed once again on Thursday, the movie was already talked about as a possible streaming play. Again, that might be a case where the benefit is relatively high — offering a subscription lure to a particular group of fans — and the risk low, given the film's uncertain box-office potential. Clearly, the prospect of millions more people staying at home could be a short-term boon to these fledgling streaming ventures, as well as traditional TV networks. In that regard, companies like Disney, ViacomCBS (VIACA), NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia (the parent of CNN) — which own multiple channels — are positioned to have more people watching broadcast and cable even if they don't ante up for their individual services. Sliding release dates for movies, especially if the crisis drags on, could create a logjam. But because movies are ordered far in advance, studios could potentially cut back on production, using the held-back inventory to flesh out their schedules.  Disney announced on Friday that it is pausing production on some of its live-action films for a short time. That includes ""The Little Mermaid"" remake and Marvel Studios' ""Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings,"" among others. At this point, though, there are plenty of unknowns.  ""You move one movie, then that potentially impacts five others. It's a domino effect,"" said Robbins of Boxoffice.com. ""The box office has never really had to deal with something as widespread as the coronavirus before. There's no timetable to when things get back to normal, and there's just so many questions left to answer.""",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/success/teacher-work-from-home-coronavirus/index.html,Tips from a teacher: How to homeschool your kids while working during a global pandemic,"At the end of January, as coronavirus concerns grew in China, he and his two children, Jamie 10 and Rosalyn 7, returned home to Glasgow, Scotland. His wife, a journalist, remained in China. For the past six and a half weeks, McLauchlan has been on his own with his kids, who have spent much of that time self-quarantined at home with him after returning from China. All the while he is distance-teaching his students at the international school -- who are now spread out from New Zealand to Miami, with a time zone difference of 18 hours -- and managing a team of teachers. He is weeks ahead of many American families who are just starting several weeks of working at home with their children because of coronavirus-related closures. As a teacher and a parent, he answers questions about how to manage getting work done, while keeping kids supported at home. What is your family's situation? The speed of change was lightning quick. When we arrived home in Glasgow, little was known about the virus and we chose to self-isolate for two weeks. During this time, I was teaching and leading a team of six teachers and trying to get systems up and running for virtual learning. I was then swamped with the triple task of leading a team, preparing and managing systems for teaching my own class, as well as home educating and single parenting my kids. At first, I openly expressed to friends how much I was looking forward to the home educating part. I'm a teacher. I have skills with this stuff. And these are my kids. It will be like the best continuous snow day possible! Erm... It was hard. I was permanently on my screen -- trying to keep everything going at school. Supporting staff and students and parents. After a week, I realized that it wasn't the best option for my own kids [given that schools in Scotland were open]. Two weeks later, they were both in local schools. They loved being back at school. The social dynamic and bonding was sorely missed. But now it looks like UK schools will inevitably close again soon. How much structure should a parent provide or hope to maintain? As a parent I was bombarded with information from the school. It was all helpful and constructive but too much to take in, in one gulp. Multiply that by a factor of how many kids you have. My decision was to actually ignore the learning activities that came from PE, Art, Music and Language and focus on the [core] teaching. We did this in the morning, and once we got a system going it worked fairly well. But even then I found myself frazzled trying to cope with my own work and keeping the kids focused and motivated.  Break times were spent eating snacks and listening to episodes of WOW In The World podcasts (absolute gold for kids). Afternoons were spent outside. I bought them both scooters and that became our PE lesson. We hoarded boxes and toilet paper rolls and made a gigantic junk airplane. We drew pictures. Then, when they were in bed I spent the rest of my evening working again. A sense of routine is key. Establish it and maintain it. What are the biggest unforeseen challenges kids face? Face-to-face time is the biggest loss for kids. Undoubtedly. They miss friends and the social dynamic of school, which is impossible to replicate at home or on Zoom. They are the most social of creatures and need that space away from us as much as we need a glass of wine or two at 8 pm on a Friday, or other nights of the week too!  They feel isolation and boredom and frustration, too. And, actually, although online games are good, they risk stripping kids from the normal social interaction of school. We tried to do as many analogue activities as possible.  And this, importantly, was also the feedback from our parents. For the first week of online learning we sent lots of reminder links to the various online platforms we use to support learning in school. But parent reaction was quite negative to this and they assumed that this was the normal day for their child and expressed concern that they had not realized how much time their child was spending on the iPad in school. Which could not be more opposite from the truth.  So, in week two we focused all our efforts on quality offline tasks that required next to no devices and are easily explained. Week two went superbly and we've kept this system going since with no complaints. What are the biggest unforeseen challenges parents face? How do you avoid the gravitational pull toward news online?  Short answer. I haven't. It's impossible. I read and watch Netflix in the evenings. But even then my phone is in my hand. I can't find the strength to put it down. I actually had taken a prolonged break from Twitter and Facebook for nearly a year and have only been back on both sites for the last month. The main reason is to share and support other teachers who have or will be going through the same process. And to keep family informed through Facebook.  But it's been a nightmare. I was blissfully unaware of the social media noise in China because I don't speak the language and don't use these platforms. And, at first, the rest of the world was just observing China. But now it is global, it feels impossible to escape the fear, anxiety and emotions. I feel these too, but actually they add to the intense isolation that comes from spending long hours working on screens and being contained inside the home. I've not perfected the balance and I doubt anyone will. Yes, we stay positive for and in front of our kids and students. But in quiet moments of reflection, black humor and lots of swearing keeps me going in WeChat and WhatsApp groups!  I've also eaten a lot of biscuits and crisps. Self-health is a huge challenge. Some people will be unbelievably positive and model perfect self-isolation homes and lifestyles. They are incredibly annoying. It's like the home-school bloggers that paint a picture perfect utopia of home learning. School certainly isn't like that, and neither should it be right now. It's ok to have bad days, to feel guilty, to realize you have neglected your kids for three hours. It's not ok if you keep doing it every day. But don't beat yourself up and expect the home learning experience to be perfect. Words of advice for parents on how to talk to their kids, support them or manage expectations? Don't lose each other in separate online worlds. You on Facebook, them on Minecraft. Find ways to interact together on screens, like FaceTime, messages, social gaming, family movies, but also away from screens. The social interaction they miss is more about not being with other people physically. Board games, card games, long walks, bike rides, all that old fashioned stuff works. And for parents to ditch their phones when spending these times together, which is easier said than done.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/coronavirus-uk-pubs-wages/index.html,UK government will pay 80% of wages as it closes pubs to fight coronavirus,"Unveiling an unprecedented intervention by the state in the British economy, finance minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that the government will cover 80% of worker salaries for at least the next three months up to a maximum of £2,500 ($2,900) a month, which is more than the average income.  Sunak said the measures would apply to all companies, large or small. The measure was part of a bigger rescue package for British businesses, including tax relief totaling £30 billion and interest-free loans for up to 12 months. A deep recession is looming as activity across the economy grinds to a halt.  In recent days, the UK government has been criticized for not taking the coronavirus outbreak seriously enough, and relying on citizens to practice social distancing rather than simply shutting down bars and restaurants. Speaking at the same news conference, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced stricter measures to enforce social distancing, including the enforced closures of pubs, restaurants, theaters, cinemas and gyms. Johnson said establishments would be closed to the public starting Saturday but they could continue to offer food to go. He said he was confident the ""tide could be turned"" in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak, but people needed to stay away from one another. Sunak said the government has never had a program on this scale to pay wages and had to build its system ""from scratch,"" he said, adding that ""unlimited funding"" is available. The first payments would be made within weeks, with the program fully up and running by the end of April. Companies and employees will respond with ""relief and determination,"" said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group. ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback — an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" she said in a statement.  Mike Hawes, CEO of the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement that the measures will come as a ""huge relief"" to car companies, their workers and families. He said 99% of the UK automotive industry had come to a halt, meaning ""thousands of businesses are counting their future not in months or weeks, but in days."" The measures come on top of programs unveiled by the UK government earlier in the week to support individuals and businesses, including £330 billion in loan guarantees and suspending local business taxes for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors for 12 months. Mortgage providers have also agreed to delay payments for three months for people affected by the coronavirus. Britain's rescue package goes even further than similar dramatic interventions unveiled by governments in Denmark and Australia in recent days. Companies in Denmark that would otherwise be forced to cut staff by 30% or lose more than 50 people will receive government funds to cover 75% of their wage bills for three months, the Ministry of Employment said in a statement on Sunday. The compensation is capped at 23,000 Danish krone ($3,300) per employee. Australia is giving 6.7 billion Australian dollars ($3.9 billion) to 690,000 small businesses employing around 7.8 million people, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced last week. UK recession inevitable Deutsche Bank economists expect UK GDP to contract by 4% this year, as the economy is hit by weaker global growth, a slowdown in Europe, its largest trading partner, supply chain disruptions and a drop in business activity related to social distancing measures.  If the spread and duration of the coronavirus is larger and longer than anticipated, the economy could shrink by as much 6%, making this ""the worst recession for a century,"" they said in a research note Friday.  — Charles Riley, Julia Horowitz and Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/oil-crash-saudi-arabia-russia-trump/index.html,How America can fight back in the oil war with Russia and Saudi Arabia,"Trump has in the past hammered OPEC for keeping oil prices too high, hurting American drivers when they fill up their gas tanks.   Now, Russia is intentionally tanking prices in a bid to derail the US shale oil boom. And Saudi Arabia is punishing Russia by ramping up production at the worst possible time.   The severe nature of the oil crash and America's newfound role as the world's leading oil producer has shifted Trump's calculus.   An epic battle for oil domination between Russia and Saudi Arabia has amplified the coronavirus mayhem on Wall Street. Oil prices are in free-fall, crashing to 18-year lows this week. Energy stocks are crumbling. And energy junk-bond yields are spiking.  To survive, the US oil industry is slashing spending, cutting dividends and preparing for layoffs.  Countless workers, many of them in Republican-leaning states like Texas, could lose their jobs. Some shale oil drillers that took on too much debt won't survive at all.   ""You always get a little torn,"" Trump said during a press briefing Thursday. ""Until we became the leading producer, I was always for the person driving the car and filling up the tank of gas...If (prices) were too high, I would always raise hell with OPEC.""  Now Trump, under pressure from some oil companies, has signaled a willingness to step into the middle of the Saudi-Russia battle.   ""It hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry,"" Trump said. ""At the appropriate time, I'll get involved.""  Time to punish Russia, Saudi Arabia? The Trump administration has already moved forward with plans to fill up the nation's emergency stockpile by purchasing vast amounts of crude from small and medium-sized US producers.   The Energy Department plans to ask Congress for funding to buy tens of millions of barrels of oil , which will come very cheap given the crash in prices.  US officials are also exploring a diplomatic effort to get Saudi Arabia to stop flooding the market with cheap oil and cut production instead, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Trump administration is also considering sanctions on Russia aimed at stabilizing prices, the paper said.  However, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business there is no movement to impose sanctions on Russia.   Russian officials suggested on Friday that Trump shouldn't get in the middle of this fight.   ""We know that the huge US oil sector is now in distress because of these prices,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. ""There are no price wars between Russia and Saudi Arabia....We have good partnership relations with Saudi Arabia, and we do not think that anyone should intervene in these relations.""  Texas could cap production But there are risks involved with a more heavy-handed intervention, including undercutting America's role as a champion of free markets in what is a cartel-driven oil industry.   For instance, Texas regulators are reportedly considering imposing limits on the state's oil production. The Railroad Commission of Texas, which despite its name regulates much of the state's energy industry, hasn't used that power in more than 40 years.  The goal would be to ease the devastating supply glut by cutting output in the epicenter of America's shale oil boom. The Permian Basin of West Texas is the nation's largest oilfield, accounting for the vast majority of skyrocketing production.    Yet production limits would defy the oil industry's free-market ethos -- and do little to solve the destruction in demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. ""While I am open to any and all ideas to protect the Texas Miracle, as a free-market conservative I have a number of reservations about this approach,"" Wayne Christian, the Railroad Commission's chairman, said in a statement Friday. ""Texas does not operate in a vacuum. If we prorate our oil, there is no guarantee other nations, or even states will follow suit."" And the influential American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's biggest lobby, opposes such restrictions by Texas.   ""We shouldn't abandon our principles during difficult times. We should be an example to the rest of the world about free market capitalism,"" Frank Macchiarola, the API's senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, told CNN Business.   If anything, installing production limits would be taking a page out of the playbook of OPEC, the 15-member organization that essentially acts as a cartel by coordinating production to influence prices.   ""We would now be adopting their style of governance,"" Macchiarola said.   Tariff Man to the rescue? Goldman Sachs warned that production caps would fail to offset the severe decline in demand caused by airline shutdowns and travel restrictions.   Such policies ""would simply replace OPEC's artificial price support policy with another, further pushing investors away from a sector that has already destroyed significant amounts of capital,"" Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a client note Thursday.   Some have even called for Trump, who has referred to himself as ""Tariff Man,"" to impose tariffs on oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia.  And the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, a coalition of US oil and gas producers, is pushing for the Trump administration to launch an anti-dumping investigation into Russia and Saudi Arabia for ""oil price manipulation.""   The group, led by oil billionaire Harold Hamm, filed a petition with the US Commerce Department last week to consider duties on oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia.  ""This is a direct attack on U.S. oil and gas producers,"" Hamm wrote in a statement. ""They are taking advantage of this coronavirus pandemic that is sweeping the world to focus on this industry and to devastate it.""  There could also be political obstacles involved with intervening on behalf of oil producers.   The plunge in oil prices has driven gasoline prices below $2 a gallon in at least a dozen states. That's a rare bit of positive financial news at a time of rising unemployment and cratering financial markets. ",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/business/walmart-workers-retail-coronavirus/index.html,What it's like working at Walmart during a pandemic,"""The routine is up in the air. You never know what you're walking into and we are out of basic cleaning supplies [to sell],"" said Gary, a Walmart employee in New York who spoke to CNN Business under the condition that his last name be withheld from this article out of fear of losing his job. His coworkers are ""tired and frustrated"" because they are working at a faster pace than normal and are struggling to meet overwhelming demand from jittery shoppers for groceries and household staples.  Although he is not ""terribly worried"" about getting coronavirus himself, he is concerned for older employees in his store. ""I want people to get the things they need, but I have to weigh that against keeping my people safe,"" said one Walmart employee in Arizona who also spoke under the condition of anonymity out of job concerns. This employee is concerned most about riots breaking out in the store. ""Customers are clearly scared, panicked, and very on edge.""  A Walmart spokesperson said that ""while this is a challenging time, people have remained relatively calm,"" adding, ""we're thankful for the way our associates have pulled together."" Nearly every grocery store, retailer and major company in the service industry in America is facing similar conditions as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. But it's a particular hurdle at Walmart supercenters, which average around 180,000 square feet, with roughly 120,000 items on the shelves and have about 300 workers. Supercenters are local hubs and 24-hour gathering areas in many American towns and cities.  ""The supercenter, it's a place that, in many communities, it's central to the community -— like the heartbeat,"" Walmart (WMT) US CEO John Furner said at an investor conference last month. ""It's often one of the largest employers in town. It's one of the largest grocers in town.""  Employees are scrambling to adjust to rapidly changing conditions on the ground and contain the spread of the virus. Workers say it's been busier in the past week than during the holiday season. Walmart is giving store managers discretion to limit purchase quantities of items that are in unusually high demand, such as hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes. Employees are prioritizing stocking shelves as soon as delivery trucks drop off boxes of supplies, instead of filling up throughout the day. On Sunday, Walmart began closing its stores overnight to give employees time to stock shelves and scrub down aisles. Walmart is cleaning cash registers, checkout stations, shopping carts and employee breakrooms more frequently than usual and giving employees step-by-step processes with videos and photos on how to clean. Employees have a voice-activated app called Ask Sam that they can use to ask for cleaning guides for any area of the store, the company said. For customers, Walmart has also put out cleaning wipes and hand sanitizer pumps at the entrance of stores, according to the company. Last year, Walmart, the largest private employer in America implemented a policy that tied workers' quarterly bonuses in part to their attendance records to limit absences. But Walmart has waived that policy through the end of April.  The company is telling employees who are not feeling well to stay home, but they have to take their regular paid sick leave to do so. Walmart has also created an emergency paid leave policy for employees who get coronavirus or who live in areas under quarantine. Some workers say they are relieved they have access to paid leave if they become infected with coronavirus and won't lose their jobs.  Other employees hope Walmart will take greater precautions in stores to limit the risk of an infection or consider closing stores altogether and switching to only in-store pickup or home delivery. Customers and employees are not practicing social distancing, said Gary, the worker in New York. ""Management continues to have regular staff meetings where we are corralled into a giant group shoulder to shoulder.""",3/21/2020

""The FDIC is separately calling upon Newsmax.com to stop publishing these misleading ads and to issue a correction to its readers following its publication of 'Walls Street's Worst Nightmare,'"" the FDIC said in a press release.   In the March 17 email advertisement cited by the FDIC, Monetary Gold said that federal law allowed banks to seize money from checking, savings, and other accounts and ""use those funds when necessary to keep itself, the bank, afloat.""  ""These assertions are false,"" the FDIC said. ""Federal law is clear that in the unlikely event of a bank failure, customers' insured deposits would be fully protected up to the $250,000 limit."" In addition to a website, Newsmax Media also has a print magazine and a cable news channel called Newsmax TV. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive officer of Newsmax, told CNN Business on Friday afternoon, after this story was published, that he planned to review the advertisement in question. Ruddy said Newsmax would ""take appropriate steps"" and that in the meantime the advertiser had been suspended while the review takes place. ""We have no record the FDIC ever tried to contact Newsmax about this matter,"" Ruddy added, saying he has contacted the federal agency asking for who was specifically contacted. Brian Sullivan, a spokesperson for the FDIC, told CNN Business that Newsmax has been ""unresponsive"" to the federal agency.  Sullivan said the FDIC has reached out to NewsMax through email, phone calls, and voicemails.  ""In response, crickets,"" Sullivan said. A representative for Monetary Gold did not respond to a request for comment. Brian Sullivan, a spokesperson for the FDIC, told CNN Business on Friday that, thus far, NewsMax has been ""unresponsive"" to the federal agency.  Sullivan said the FDIC has reached out to NewsMax through email, phone calls, and voicemails.  ""In response, crickets,"" Sullivan said. Advertisements that aim to frighten Americans about the security of their money in major financial institutions would likely have a heightened effect this week, given the fear generated by the coronavirus crisis. The FDIC, formed during the Great Depression, is responsible for protecting depositors from bank runs. The agency insures trillions of dollars in banks across the United States. The FDIC's insurance fund is backed by the credit of the federal government. Regulators are trying to keep panicked Americans from making bank runs during the coronavirus pandemic that would add more stress to a banking system already bracing for a potentially severe economic recession. It could even in theory cause some shortages of physical cash in certain bank branches.  Regulators have stressed that unlike in 2008, America's banks are very strong today. They've been forced to bulk up on capital that can cushion losses caused by defaults and foreclosures. Furthermore, banks have been banned from some of the extreme risk-taking that led to the 2008 crisis.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/tech/google-coronavirus-website-rollout-delay/index.html,Google delays its planned rollout of an informational coronavirus website,"The informational website had been targeted for a launch late Monday, CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post over the weekend.  But on Monday evening, Google (GOOGL) told CNN Business it will not launch the site until it can provide users with additional information that is not yet available. ""With local and national guidance evolving rapidly, Google will continue working with relevant agencies and authorities to roll out a website later this week that will surface authoritative information for people in the US, including on screening and testing,"" Google said in a statement. Despite the reference to screening and testing, Google still does not appear to be developing a nationwide tool to directly survey patients for their symptoms and guide them to testing sites, as the Trump administration has claimed in recent days.  Instead, Google's website is expected to display some information about how Americans can access screening, and separately, list other information about local testing sites. Google is still waiting for more information about both before launching the site. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is developing its own screening tool, according to Google, that the search giant plans to link to from its informational website. The CDC tool is expected to feature a questionnaire that Americans can use to help determine if they need medical attention, which could include testing.  Meanwhile, Google is also waiting for more information about local testing sites, which remains in flux as US testing capacity develops. When more becomes available about the testing sites, Google said, it hopes to give users access to that information across its suite of services, such as Google search, maps, and the informational website.  Google's announcement follows the launch of a website by its sister company, Verily, which is aimed at guiding users directly to testing locations, but only for Californians living in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. Verily has said it hopes to expand its tool, but has not issued a timeframe for its deployment.  The two websites were the subject of great confusion after President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence announced that Google is working on a tool that will direct Americans to local testing sites. But Google's announcement, including its remarks Monday evening, stop short of meeting that description. ",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/investing/strong-dollar-coronavirus/index.html,The dollar is on a tear. Here's why that's troubling,"The value of the greenback is surging, up more than 7% against a basket of other currencies -- such as the euro, British pound and Swiss franc -- since hitting the lowest point of 2020 on March 9. But this strong demand from other countries around the world has created a liquidity crunch -- essentially a dollar shortage. There are worries that this could further disrupt global financial markets.  ""This collapse in global activity leaves a lot of people with US dollar liabilities to finance, and not enough dollars coming in to do it,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, in a report. ""It doesn't matter that they don't owe these dollars to Americans...what matters is that they need dollars and need them now,"" Juckes added. That appears to be the main rationale behind moves from the Federal Reserve to roll out new dollar loans (known as swap lines) with five major central banks on Sunday and an expansion of the program with nine other central banks on Thursday. The Fed announced further plans Friday to step up the frequency of dollar swaps with The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.  The arrangements will now be daily -- as opposed to just weekly -- starting Monday and will last until at least the end of April.  ""Any stress in wholesale funding markets is getting noticed, and anything done to address it matters. Expanding the swap lines to more countries could continue to improve currency funding constraints,"" said Lauren Goodwin, economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, in a report. The resurgent dollar may create another big problem for giant US multinational companies that are already staring to struggle from lower demand abroad as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive -- and therefore less competitive -- than foreign made goods. Benefits to a strong dollar as well Still, the demand for the dollar is also a good psychological sign.  It shows that investors around the globe are still in confident in America's status is the world's leading economy and the dollar as a reserve currency for the world. ""The dollar is rallying because it is a safe haven currency. And that has some benefits,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. With that in mind, Schutte said investors should not worry about what the dollar will do to corporate profits. A stronger dollar also makes imported goods cheaper for American consumers. ""The US is still the number one economic power on the planet. There is a reason that the dollar and Treasury bonds are considered the healthiest in the world. This is unavoidable and in the long run it is not harmful,"" said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, a company that provides advice for 401(k) plans. Still, some experts question if the dollar can rally much further from these levels.  It might be time for the dollar to give back some of its gains -- especially as other countries begin to realize that they need to prop up their own currencies. ""The main risk for the dollar is G7 currency intervention. With the rise in the greenback driving many currencies to multi-year lows, central banks from Brazil to Norway have rushed to prevent further losses,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a report.  ""There's a very good chance that coordinated action on a global scale will be next. If they come into the market, it will be to sell dollars, not buy them,"" Lien added. ",3/21/2020

TJX (TJX), the parent company of TJMaxx and Marshalls, announced earlier on Thursday that it will close for two weeks. Kohl's (KSS) also plans to close stores Thursday.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/business/grocery-shopping-online-coronavirus/index.html,Coronavirus will change the grocery industry forever,"While shopping for books and electronics online and ordering dinner through delivery apps have become staples of American life, most customers still prefer to purchase their meat and vegetables at the store. Last year, just 4% of grocery sales in the United States came online, according to Nielsen. However, with shoppers stuck in their homes in the wake of the virus, online grocery shopping is exploding. Downloads of Instacart, Walmart's grocery app and Shipt increased 218%, 160%, and 124% respectively last Sunday compared with a year prior. ""We are seeing a larger percentage of customers over the age of 60 that are coming online,"" said JJ Fleeman, chief e-commerce officer for Ahold Delhaize in the United States, which owns brands like Stop & Shop, Food Lion and the online delivery service Peapod. ""We're seeing a lot of new customers coming into the channel."" A third of consumers said Sunday that they had purchased groceries for online pickup or delivery in the past seven days, according to a survey by analysts at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Around 41% said they were buying groceries online for the first time. ""Consumer behaviors always shift in times of disaster,"" said Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations at FMI, a trade group for food retailers. ""People are learning new skills and how to shop online as a result of what we're experiencing today."" Maria Alvarado in Phoenix usually shops in person for groceries at Walmart or Safeway, but she tried ordering online last week for the first time through Walmart's in-store pickup option. She plans to keep using the service. ""Once things go back to normal, I will probably use online again,"" she said. ""It was really easy."" Big grocers like Walmart, Albertsons, Stop & Shop, Meijer, Hy-Vee and others have been experimenting with new ways to fulfill online orders in recent years. They have increasingly looked to technology to reduce costs and keep aisles from jamming up with shoppers and workers picking customers' orders. Grocers have been building automated mini-warehouses inside their stores and opening up ""dark stores"" — locations that look like supermarkets but are closed to customers — to make deliveries and prepare pickup orders. Yet the crush of demand in the wake of coronavirus has overwhelmed grocers' delivery and pickup networks, causing long waits, cancellations and outages in some parts of the country.  ""The surge in online grocery orders is causing operational difficulties,"" said Bill Bishop, CEO of grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.  Grocers are scrambling to adjust and hiring workers to keep up.  Fleeman from Ahold Delhaize said the company was adding ""web servers to help us process the increased demand"" and offering more windows for customers to pickup their orders or get delivery. This shift online during the crisis may reshape the supermarket industry by helping large grocers consolidate their grip, experts predict. ""We see this unfortunate period accelerating structural changes in consumer shopping,"" possibly by five years, said Seth Sigman, analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report. ""This is driving significant growth in new customers"" to Walmart (WMT). Consumers adopting online grocery shopping may add to the pressure small and mid-sized grocers already face, analysts say. These smaller chains don't have as much capital to invest in building out their delivery infrastructure. And delivery is less profitable for grocers than traditional purchases in stores. Coronavirus ""may hasten the adoption"" of online delivery and pickup, touching off long-term challenges for smaller chains earlier than expected, Kelly Bania, analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said in a research report this week.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/economy/coronavirus-stimulus/index.html,Coming soon: At least $1.7 trillion in government stimulus to help sick economies,"Morgan Stanley says spending commitments from the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and China add up to at least $1.7 trillion — so far. ""While the initial response from developed economies was slow, over the last few days — as economic and financial market disruptions persist — we have started to see strong commitments from policy makers, indicating a sizable fiscal expansion plan is in the offing,"" Morgan Stanley chief economist Chetan Ahya told clients this week. That includes the $1 trillion package under discussion in the United States, which still needs Congressional approval. The plan was formally rolled out by Senate Republicans on Thursday, setting the stage for negotiations to begin in earnest. The program includes $200 billion in loans to airlines and distressed industry sectors and $300 billion in forgivable bridge loans for small businesses. It also proposes direct payments to Americans under a certain income threshold — up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples. UBS estimates that fiscal stimulus this year will soar to nearly 2% of global GDP, exceeding what was approved in 2009 to fight the Great Recession. (That figure excludes credit guarantees.) The global wave of stimulus pledges has been matched by action from central banks.  UBS said Thursday that 60% of central banks had slashed interest rates since January 20. Those cuts have been coupled with massive asset purchase programs, such as the European Central Bank's €750 billion ($803 billion) commitment this week. But after years of low interest rates and bond buying, central banks are now running low on ammunition — adding pressure on governments to follow with more fiscal stimulus should their initial efforts prove insufficient. Economists expect that governments will have to intervene further given the scale of the economic devastation that could unfold in the coming weeks and months.  Goldman Sachs said Friday that the US economy will shrink at an annual rate of 6% between January and March compared to the previous quarter, and a shocking 24% between April and June. It predicts a rebound in the second half of the year, but expects the world's largest economy to contract 3.8% for the year. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at research firm Capital Economics, called the $1 trillion stimulus plan ""a first step"" that will need to be followed up. ""With layoffs already surging and a clear risk that the lockdown now in place in California may have to be extended across greater parts of the country, significantly more fiscal support may still be needed to avoid a protracted recession,"" he told clients on Friday. Kevin Hassett, an economist and former CNN commentator who is returning to the Trump administration to work on its coronavirus response, is bracing for an even more dire situation. ""We're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that's risky,"" Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Thursday. ""Because at some point, we can't not have an economy, right?""",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/tech/quarantine-privacy-coronavirus/index.html,"In the battle against coronavirus, personal privacy is at risk","He was told to register on the app once he got home, which would start a 14-day countdown, and walk to all four corners of his apartment so it could capture the location and confines of his home.  As countries around the world fight the spread of the coronavirus, several governments are using technology to monitor quarantines — particularly of people coming in from overseas. Israel this week approved the use of cellphone tracking technology to monitor suspected coronavirus patients — an option normally used only for counterterrorism. Thailand is reportedly giving all new arrivals at its airports a free SIM card and making them download an app that tracks their location for 14 days. But there are concerns that tracking measures to contain the pandemic could pave the way for greater government surveillance. In Israel, for example, Opposition politicians and constitutional experts criticized the tracking measures, not only for their invasion of privacy but also for the lack of parliamentary oversight in pushing them through.  The urgency to fight the coronavirus could open up a new front in the long-running global debate between privacy and security. Over the years, some governments have relied on controversial practices such as using facial recognition and phone data collection to protect citizens, potentially at the expense of their personal privacy.  ""I think the question might be whether the means justify the ends,"" Jennifer King, director of privacy at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society, told CNN Business. ""I'd want to hear a clear justification as to why some of the requests for personal data are being made, and why other methods might not work as well or reasonably well without the privacy impact."" Chan's wristband is one of 60,000 that Hong Kong is deploying to enforce quarantines and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The wristband and the app were developed in collaboration with a local startup ""to ascertain people under quarantine are staying at their dwelling places,"" according to a government statement.  Chan, 36, said he wasn't explicitly told what would happen if he took off the wristband or disconnected the app. A form he was given -- a photo of which he shared with CNN Business -- says that anyone who ""contravenes or knowingly gives false information to [the] Department of Health"" is liable to face a 5000 HKD ($644) fine and six months in prison.  ""Should the app be deleted during quarantine period, the Department of Health and the police will be alerted to take follow-up action,"" a Hong Kong government spokesperson told CNN Business. The spokesperson said users are free to delete the app after 14 days. The governments have painted the quarantine tracking and monitoring as necessary steps to curb the virus, while also insisting they are committed to protecting privacy.  ""The [Hong Kong government] attaches great importance to privacy protection,"" the spokesperson said, adding that its tracking app does not collect any additional data from the users' smartphone. ""The collection of personal data is minimal in accordance with the provision of the quarantine order."" Israel's deputy attorney general, Raz Nizri, said tracking people is ""essential"" to save lives. ""The aim was to find the optimal solution that will minimize the infringement of privacy,"" he told Kan Reshen Bet radio.  Thai authorities will delete user data collected by their tracking app within 14 days, an official at the country's telecommunications authority told the Bangkok Post newspaper. Experts say that while some amount of tracking may be necessary to contain the virus, users need to be protected from it being turned into a broader surveillance tool. ""Mandatory orders or those with no explicit restrictions on the collection and use of the data would be very worrisome,"" said King. There is also the risk that measures seemingly justified by the current pandemic could be retained or expanded even after they are no longer necessary. ""I think we have to be on the lookout for 'scope creep' — contexts where we demand emergency powers that risk privacy and then fail to walk back after the emergency passes,"" she said. The US government is also in discussions with the tech industry to use Americans' location data to track the spread of the coronavirus, with Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) confirming they are exploring ways to share aggregated, anonymized data rather than location data of specific users, a point they took great pains to emphasize. But larger Western democracies will likely face bigger challenges and greater pushback in trying to institute some of the tracking measures other countries have.  ""Every country is different, and I think that the incentive to engage in this sort of tracking is higher for smaller countries that have dense populations and the political will and technology necessary to make this happen — like Israel and Hong Kong,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook and Obama administration official who is now a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ""It is difficult to imagine these policies extending to Western democratic countries at this time.""  Chan said he preferred being forced to quarantine at home rather than being placed in a government facility.  ""I kind of feel weird that there's no other option, other than the bracelets. I do feel a bit weird,"" he said. ""But it's the lesser of the two evils, if I have to choose between this and a quarantine camp... at least home is a safer environment."" ",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/success/working-from-home-with-kids-coronavirus/index.html,How to work from home with kids (without losing it),"The coronavirus pandemic has forced schools to close across the country, and many employees are already working from home. With social distancing keeping people isolated for the time being, school and work are now taking place at home, and largely at the same time.  ""It has been stressful figuring it out,"" said Alicia Carrithers a fitness company marketer and single mom to two boys, ages 9 and 1, who lives in Kirkland, Washington. She is working from home and her son's school is closed until at least April 24.   A nanny and the baby's father will split time with her youngest while she works. Her older son's school is developing a distance learning plan. ""But how much am I going to need to manage him doing that work?"" she said. ""He's nine and tends to turn toward video games. I only have one laptop that I use for my job.""  As families face these new challenges to work-life balance in close quarters, parents are trying to keep their kids healthy and busy while still doing their jobs and not totally losing their minds.  How can parents make this work? Set a tone of understanding and empathy Working from home with our children for an unknown period of time is uncharted territory for families, said Elana Benatar, a child therapist at Lotus Point Wellness in the Washington DC area. ""We are all figuring it out,"" she said. ""It might get a little messy.""  It is important to talk to children about what is happening, at an age appropriate level, she said. Some children may not understand what is going on and only see that you are limiting them in ways that don't seem reasonable.  ""Explain to them that we are all trying to look out for our community,"" Benatar said. It's like that old ""Mister Rogers'"" quote, about responding to scary news by asking people to 'Look for the helpers,' she said. ""They are being the helpers right now,"" she said. ""Part of how we help each other right now is to stay home.""  If Mister Rogers doesn't register, explain social distancing using Elsa and Anna of Disney's ""Frozen"" movies. Elsa had to stay away from her sister to keep her sister safe. Organizing your child's days around work time that can't be interrupted will be best for most families, Benatar said. Have an engaging activity planned or screen time available to keep them busy will help get you through your toughest work obligations. Establish a routine early, and stick with it Katie Stone Perez, a program manager for Xbox in Redmond, Washington, who pulled her daughters Emma, 8, and Elizabeth, 10, out of their school on March 2, has already been working from home with her kids for a couple of weeks.  While some parents are looking to home school schedules and sharing lists of online activities that are temporarily waiving subscription fees, others are removing the caps on screen time. Perez is trying to strike the balance between the two. But technology in the morning proved troublesome, Perez said. ""If I let them have electronics first thing in the morning, their attitudes go downhill and they fight and bicker.""  Instead they start with a ""care plan,"" like getting dressed, having breakfast, getting outside for a bit. Then they do their ""work plan"" for the day, which includes school work as well as supplemental activities Perez found like documentaries on Disneynature that have activity packets to download on subjects including the Arctic, pandas and pirates. In the late afternoon they socialize and play video games with friends remotely, including creating a ""realm"" in MineCraft so that they have a safe invite-only space to hang out.  Her kids are also getting a dose of life skills, too, because: ""The dishes. Oh my god. It is real,"" she said. ""If they can come out of this and be more self-sufficient around the house, that's tremendous."" Divide and ... get by Maira Wenzel and her husband both work for Microsoft and have been working from home for two weeks. They found that they can work together in the one office they have, but not if they are both on calls.  ""We made another little office, but it is in the middle of the kids' playroom,"" she said. Appearing on video calls surrounded by toys has helped her colleagues to be more understanding of the situation, Wenzel said, especially now that her kindergartener and third grader have joined them after their school closed on Thursday.  She and her husband plan to divide up kid-duty based on their work calendars. On Friday, the kids' first day home, Wenzel treated it like a day off, letting them play video games and relax, before settling into a routine. But she had to step in to quiet them when her husband was on a conference call and the children were screaming.  ""Eventually it will happen to everyone,"" she said.  Realistic expectations There is no professional advantage to pretending things are normal, said Nicole Coomber, a professor of management and organization at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at University of Maryland.  You will reduce your anxiety and better manage everyone's expectations if you are upfront with coworkers about what is going on, she says. ""We know that when teams have high levels of trust and a feeling of safety, they are better performing,"" she said. ""When you are open with colleagues, it helps them understand they can be honest, too."" She put this into practice on Friday when she took her four sons, ages 4 to 9, hiking, even though she also had a conference call. With 50-plus attendees on the call, she modeled being real for others by acknowledging that she was with her kids outdoors. Similarly, be honest with yourself about having your kids at home, she said. ""Our kids' teachers are professionals,"" she said. ""I can't become an elementary teacher overnight. It is unrealistic for most of us and everyone needs to have more grace with themselves at work and at home.""  Especially since, for a while anyway, they are one and the same.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/media/nbc-trump-reporter/index.html,"NBC News staffers fire back at Trump, call his attack on reporter 'outrageous' and 'absolutely nuts'  ","Outrage inside NBC  Staffers at NBC News are outraged (and a bit confused) after President Trump viciously attacked their network's White House correspondent, Peter Alexander, at Friday's coronavirus briefing. Alexander, if you didn't see, asked Trump what he would say to Americans who are frightened amid the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of answering, Trump responded by rejecting the question (""nasty""), attacking Alexander (""terrible""), and assailing NBC News' parent company Comcast (""Con-Cast"").  The verbal tirade -- which Trump defended after Kaitlan Collins asked whether it was appropriate -- did not go over well with people inside NBC News. ""Outrageous,"" one senior NBC News employee told me of Trump's behavior. ""Entirely unprompted. W.H. reporters should ask tough questions and Peter often does, BUT THAT WASN'T EVEN A TOUGH QUESTION."" Other NBC News staffers expressed a similar sentiment. ""It's absolutely nuts he was attacked for asking a legitimate question,"" one NBC News reporter told me. ""Extremely bizarre,"" said another. ""It was a totally fair question with an obviously accurate premise. The reaction made no sense."" Yet another staffer told me, ""It's unsettling when these acts happen, but we continue to do our work.""  Andy Lack's statement: ""Peter Alexander is an outstanding reporter. His line of questioning at today's White House briefing was fair, straightforward, and necessary...""   ""We call this a softball""  Appearing on NBC after the press conference, Alexander explained that he was offering Trump a platform to comfort the American people: ""I am sure there are plenty of baseball fans watching right now. In TV terms, we call this a softball. I was trying to provide the president an opportunity to reassure"" the public... King goes further: It's ""bullshit"" That's how CNN's John King referred to Trump's unhinged response to Alexander. Many other journalists joined in to back the NBC correspondent. ""Asked to perform one of the key duties of the presidency — to reassure the American public during a crisis — Trump instead attacked,"" WaPo's Ashley Parker noted.  WHCA prez Jonathan Karl added: ""It's outrageous to use the presidential bully pulpit to bully a journalist like Peter — especially at a time like this.""   Tapper's message  On his show, Jake Tapper looked straight into the camera and delivered a serious, pointed set of remarks to Trump. Tapper noted that Trump spent months belittling the threat of the virus and ""only recently acknowledged the gravity of the crisis."" He pointed out that Alexander's question would have been ""easy for any other politician.""   Tapper's conclusion: ""If the president isn't capable of leading stably and effectively he should at least for his own reputation and for the good of the country stop making things worse and consider leaving the podium to others. The Hippocratic Oath -- first do not harm -- that applies to President Trump too.""   Meanwhile, Fox's Brit Hume defends... While practically the entire journalism world rallied around Alexander, Brit Hume defended Trump. ""Legitimate question my a**,"" tweeted Hume. ""It was the kind of bullsh*t gotcha question which hack WH reporters have been asking for decades. But instead of going off on the reporter, Trump should have said the whole briefing in all its particulars was a message to people who are scared.""  Most importantly: Trump's comments came hours after NBC announced staffer's death On Friday morning Andy Lack announced that Larry Edgeworth died Thursday after testing positive for Covid-19. Edgeworth was a veteran audio technician. He is survived by his wife Crystal and two sons. Lack said the network is ""doing everything we can to support his family during this very difficult time."" Lester Holt's tribute on Friday night: ""This crisis -- no, this horror we are going through -- is perhaps too easily reduced into numbers. The number of tests. The numbers of infected. And the number of dead. Allow me a moment to put just one face to the numbers, a face we here at NBC News know well, our colleague and friend Larry Edgeworth. We lost him to this virus last night. Holt called him ""a kind and generous man who always made us smile"" and said ""we are heartbroken..."" Pompeo's words ring hollow  Near the beginning of Friday's briefing, Mike Pompeo implored Americans to ""ensure where they turn to for information is [a] reliable source"" and ""not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong."" But his words were undercut by Trump's behavior toward Alexander.  And it was quite rich listening to Pompeo make that statement, when Trump *THE DAY BEFORE* smeared the nation's top three newspapers, and praised a far-right media organization that regularly peddles conspiracy theories on his behalf. If I were Pompeo, I would focus my efforts on the President of the United States... Sean Spicer returns to briefing room Former W.H. press secretary Sean Spicer made a surprise appearance Friday in the briefing room. Spicer, who now hosts a Newsmax show, ""appeared to become the first former White House press secretary to question the President that they once served from the briefing room,"" CNN's Betsy Klein and Caroline Kelly reported.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/tech/telework-security/index.html,Millions of Americans are suddenly working from home. That's a huge security risk,"At one major US agency, some officials have resorted to holding meetings on iPhone group calls because the regular conference bridges haven't always been working, according to one federal employee. But the workaround has its limits: The group calls support only five participants at a time, the employee noted.  ""Things have worked better than I anticipated, but there are lots of hiccups still,"" said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the record. Meanwhile, as of last week the Air Force's virtual private networking software could only support 72,000 people at once, according to a federal contractor who was also not authorized to speak on the record, and telework briefing materials viewed by CNN. The Air Force employs over 145,000 in-house civilian workers, and over 130,000 full-time contractors. Change in routines can create new opportunities for hackers As they increasingly log on from home, Americans are having to meld their personal technology with professional tools at unprecedented scale. For employers, the concern isn't just about capacity, but also about workers introducing new potential vulnerabilities into their routine — whether that's weak passwords on personal computers, poorly secured home WiFi routers, or a family member's device passing along a computer virus. ""All it takes is one of their kids to get [electronically] infected and it spreads inside the house,"" said Marcus Sachs, a former vice president for national security policy at Verizon.  From there, experts say, malware could easily jump from a compromised employee's machine into a connected office network.  Experts recommend brushing up on digital hygiene and safety tips as opportunistic criminals seek to exploit the coronavirus crisis. According to the Seattle-based information security company DomainTools, hackers are increasingly creating coronavirus-related websites, apps and tracking tools meant to lure those who are simply seeking information — but which actually spread malicious software that can lock your device.  A big test for government computer systems  Meanwhile federal officials, many of whom are already overloaded as they scramble to coordinate the government's response to the coronavirus, are increasingly being asked to log on remotely. In 2017, just over a third of federal employees teleworked, according to US government statistics. Over half did not, either because they weren't approved for it or because their job requires that they be physically present. This year, those numbers may shift dramatically. ""I'm sure every agency right now is scrambling to load-test their VPNs and access points to make sure not just 10 or 20 percent of their workforce can log on, but 70 or 80 or 90 percent,"" said the former chief information officer of a major US agency. ""That will be a challenge, for sure."" Not all government agencies use VPNs exclusively anymore. As online storage and computing platforms have taken hold in corporate America, so too have they spread in government IT systems. Now, it's more common to see civil servants logging into cloud-based applications and services from wherever they are. In 2014, for example, the Federal Communications Commission began transitioning to virtual desktops. That technology allows employees to do their jobs remotely from a digital workstation that exists purely online. All they need to do is log in, and it's as if they're sitting at their usual desks. Experts note there are a significant number of Americans who will have a problem with telework because they lack a good internet connection at home. At least 25 million Americans, possibly more, do not have broadband at home, according to federal studies.  Others may not have access to office computing devices that they can take home with them — either because they were never expected to work remotely, or perhaps because their work may be extremely sensitive. How the intelligence community is adapting Among the federal workers most hamstrung by efforts to reduce their presence in the workplace are members of the intelligence community. Working on topics and systems that are classified makes it difficult at best to work from home, if not impossible. ""There are some very senior military and government officials who have the capability to do up to Secret [work] from their house, but we're talking about four-star generals and admirals and things like that,"" said Jamie Barnett, a retired US Navy rear admiral and senior vice president of government services for the secure communications firm RigNet.  ""For other classified work, there's going to be limited facilities to be able to do that,"" Barnett added, ""so that's going to take some grappling."" Agencies have already enacted safety measures and made leave policies more flexible. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence -- which oversees 16 different intelligence agencies -- says it is ""reducing staff contact88 through a variety of options including staggered shifts, flexible schedules, and social distancing practices."" In a business that demands 24/7 attention, the agencies ""are also developing and implementing appropriate response plans"" an ODNI spokesperson added. Dealing with COVID-19, however, ""is a contingency for which the IC never prepared,"" said former National Intelligence Council chairman Greg Treverton. Some who work in intelligence are contractors who, due to contract provisions, must physically report to a government facility and do their jobs under direct oversight, said the former CIO. It's possible those contracts may be reinterpreted in light of the coronavirus crisis, he said. Intelligence officials certainly have technology and practices that would make them among the most digitally secure to work outside the office, but they're still exposed. In the best of times, for example, intelligence officials can't even bring their mobile phones into the workplace, recognizing the security risk that they are. Working at home, ""you get more vulnerable and you get much less efficient because you're being careful,"" adds Treverton, who said that for the country at large, the security issues associated with teleworking are an ""enormous vulnerability."" Still, the rise of cloud computing means many workplaces are in a much better position for telework than they were even a few years ago. ""If this had happened five years ago, I would guess that a very, very large percentage of government employees would not be able to remotely access their systems or do anything from home,"" said Gordon Bitko, a former FBI chief information officer. ""Today, that's definitely not true. I can't speak to every agency, but it's far, far greater than it was.""",3/21/2020

Employees are outraged,"GameStop locations are still open in several states that have ordered non-essential retail to close, including New York and New Jersey. Starting Friday, the video game retailer began to close stores in California and Pennsylvania. California has been under a statewide shelter-in-place order since Thursday evening. The company argues it is ""essential"" because it offers mice and keyboards that could help people work from home. GameStop told CNN Business in a statement that ""we are one of many providers of these products that are remaining open at this time."" But it didn't comment on why it must remain open if other stores are also providing those items. Eight current employees told CNN Business that GameStop is keeping its stores open to profit off of a video game shopping spree during a global pandemic. Video game sales have risen for retailers and online stores, as analysts anticipate more people are playing as they stay home. PC game store Steam reported an all-time high of 21 million users on Friday. ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" launched in stores Friday and ""Doom Eternal"" was available a day earlier. Ahead of those two major video game releases, GameStop sent out an internal memo Thursday to store leaders and other employees saying that it believed its stores should be ""classified as an essential business"" and remain open during the global pandemic. It told employees in a letter viewed by CNN Business that they should direct law enforcement to call a corporate number if they tried to enforce store closures. Several current employees told CNN Business that only select shops carry the kind of equipment that can help people work from home.  GameStop primarily carries higher-end PC gaming accessories, not the more affordable and simpler tools that are most suitable for office work. ""That's absolutely ridiculous. If someone's trying to work from home, they don't want the $85 Razer keyboard we have or the $60 Razer mouse. Some cheap $20 Microsoft something is going to get them by just fine,"" said Dustin Carson, 31, a game adviser at a GameStop in Athens, Georgia. ""They can get that at Walmart. They can get that at any of these other stores that also have groceries and are arguably much more essential to being open right now."" The Athens store opened on Friday morning, even though the county is under a shelter-in-place order.  Police went to the store Friday afternoon to order that it shut down. They showed GameStop employees an 11-page ordinance that included a list of essential businesses, which CNN Business viewed. GameStop was not listed as one of them. The store closed on Friday at around 4 pm ET and it is unclear if it will reopen Saturday. Athens' police department did not return a request for comment. ""Honestly, I'm relieved,"" said Carson, ""No one needs to get sick or die over video games. They're not essential items."" As states and districts adopt new rules to counter COVID-19, GameStop said it would shift its approach: ""We are complying with all state, county, city and local ordinances and we will continue to adjust to any future developments."" GameStop is struggling financially, going through considerable layoffs and closing stores. The pandemic could hurt the company because the bulk of its profit comes selling physical copies of the games.  ""I never considered myself someone essential to a pandemic then, and I don't now,"" a GameStop shift manager in Illinois, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told CNN Business. The Illinois employee said their store made $4,000 in net sales on Sunday and Monday combined and ""that is definitely out of the norm for this time of the year."" ""I think I've cried every day since Monday... I'm trying not to cry in front of my staff,"" said a longtime current GameStop store leader in New Jersey, who didn't want to be identified for fear of being fired. ""I feel very much like a pawn. It doesn't matter what the staff on the ground does. They're just expendable.""  Employees are calling for GameStop to shut its stores, even though it will hurt them financially. One assistant store leader in California said ""I had asked my manager if we should call local law enforcement to try to enforce the closure... [the request] died in the chain of command."" He later added that his store has now closed as of Friday and that he does not expect to be paid beyond using up his vacation days. Matthew, who asked to be identified by first name only, a longtime GameStop employee, worked in a New Jersey mall store he said recently closed because the governor mandated mall closures. While most employees expressed they believe GameStop should close its stores during the pandemic, one keyholder in Virginia said, ""I do believe that they should stay open.

It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis.  A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression. More bad news: The coronavirus outbreak may just be getting started. Central banks and governments are now unleashing a tsunami of interest rate cuts, loan guarantees and new spending, tapping emergency powers to reassure investors, cushion the shock to companies and workers and preserve the foundations of a functioning economy for the future.  In the United States, the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a rescue bill that would inject $1 trillion into the economy to prevent mass layoffs as huge swaths of the world's biggest economy shut down and airlines, hotels and restaurants run out of cash. In an extraordinary move, the UK government on Friday said it would pay 80% of the wages of anyone at risk of losing their job because of the pandemic.  Yet the rescue efforts may already be too late. Goldman Sachs estimates that 2.25 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits this week — that would be the biggest number on record. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases marches higher. The global number of infections has topped 270,000, and more than 11,000 people have been killed worldwide. Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom are under partial or complete lockdowns. California, which boasts the world's fifth largest economy, has directed 40 million people to stay at home.  ""The coronavirus has created unprecedented financial and societal disruption,"" David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said this week.  Most exposed to the fallout are businesses and workers in transport, the energy industry and hospitality as international aviation shuts down, oil consumption collapses and pubs, bars and restaurants are ordered to close.  ""In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed,"" Moody's Investor Services said in a note on Friday. While the pandemic is still unfolding, economists are already thinking about how it will change the world. Many expect significant shifts in how supply chains are constructed and how global trade is conducted. The merits of capitalism, democratic systems of government and globalization are likely to come under intense scrutiny.  A warning from Apple February 17 was a holiday in the United States and stock markets were closed. But on that Monday, Apple sounded the alarm. It warned that it wouldn't meet its revenue projections for the first three months of the year because the coronavirus had reduced iPhone manufacturing capacity in China, and with Chinese stores closed or operating reduced hours, demand for the company's products was also dropping. When US markets reopened on February 18, investors pushed the company's stock down by 2.6%. The initial hit to its stock may have been modest, but Apple was the first major US company to warn that the coronavirus was affecting its business in a big way. What's more, Apple laid out exactly why the epidemic was such a big threat: the reaction to the outbreak was hammering both supply and demand.  That dual threat is exactly why pandemics can be much more damaging than many other ""black swan"" events. People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and services, as well as energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production.  ""A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact,"" the World Bank said in a report from 2013. In the month following Apple's (AAPL) warning, thousands more companies came under huge pressure. Carmakers, which rely on global supply chains and timely deliveries to keep their plants open, shuttered factories in Europe and then the United States. Airlines canceled international flights to China, and then just about everywhere else. CAPA Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, says most carriers will be bankrupt by the end of May unless governments bail them out.  Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the nature of the pandemic will encourage companies to begin reviewing the costs of global economic integration. ""The free flow of goods, capital, and people has generated enormous benefits but also created channels for rapid worldwide contagion from financial shocks, geopolitical conflicts, and epidemics,"" he said.  The debate over how companies and governments should respond is already underway, with some observers arguing that countries must make more essential products including medical supplies at home in order to prevent shortages, an impulse that could accelerate a rollback of globalization exemplified by the trade war between the United States and China.  But William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the pandemic can't undo the technological advances that have dramatically boosted global trade over the past 50 years. ""The larger question is whether those tools will be used in the same way and to the same degree as they have been,"" he said. One change that Reinsch sees coming is how executives think about the supplies they need. ""The coronavirus crisis has taught them that supply chains are a lot more fragile than they thought, that supplies can be suddenly interrupted for unexpected reasons, and that a prudent manager will not only have a Plan B, but a Plan C and Plan D as well,"" he said. Policymakers respond as markets crash Starting on February 18, US stocks entered a stunning freefall that wiped away roughly a third of their value and ended the longest bull market in history. The Dow has fallen nearly 35% since Apple issued its coronavirus warning, posting shock declines on March 9 (-7.8%), March 12 (-10%) and March 16 (-12.9%). The index closed at 19,174 points on Friday. Markets in Europe and Asia have also plunged. Europe's Stoxx 600 has lost roughly a third of its value since February 18, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has dropped 18% over the same time period. According to Bank of America, $27 trillion has been wiped off global stocks since the end of January.  Companies exposed to fallout from the pandemic have seen their stocks decimated. Shares in United Airlines (UAL) are down roughly 70% so far this year, while French carmaker Renault (RNLSY) has plummeted 62%. Marriott International's (MAR) stock is down 50% over the same period. Share prices may come under even more pressure.  According to Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, the ability of central banks to put a floor under stock markets is limited. ""History suggests that equity markets are only likely to bottom out when it becomes clear that the flow of new cases of the virus has peaked. Until this happens, we should expect stock markets to remain under pressure,"" he said. Central banks have responded to the mounting economic devastation by slashing interest rates and using other tools in their arsenal to support growth and prevent financial markets from seizing up. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates at emergency meetings on March 3 and March 15, reducing them to a record low near zero while committing $750 billion to buy government bonds and other securities.  The Bank of England has also cut interest rates twice, on March 11 and March 19. In Japan and Europe, where interest rates have been in negative territory for years, central banks have joined the Fed in announcing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of asset purchases. Governments have promised to inject huge sums into the economy. Morgan Stanley says spending commitments from the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and China add up to at least $1.7 trillion. And a much larger sum has been promised in the form of credit guarantees. ""While the initial response from developed economies was slow, over the last few days — as economic and financial market disruptions persist — we have started to see strong commitments from policy makers, indicating a sizable fiscal expansion plan is in the offing,"" Morgan Stanley chief economist Chetan Ahya told clients on Thursday. What happens next Goldman Sachs warned Friday that US GDP could plummet at an annual rate of 24% during the second quarter, with unemployment peaking around 9% later this year. The bank said that reports suggest a ""sudden surge in layoffs and a collapse in spending, both historic in size and speed."" The economic collapse predicted by Goldman would be significantly worse than the sharpest contraction during the Great Recession, when GDP dropped by a rate of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. It would also surpass the previous post-World-War-II record of 10% set in early 1958. The picture is much the same in other countries where businesses are shutting down because of the coronavirus. According to Deutsche Bank, if the pandemic affects the United Kingdom for longer than expected, its economy could shrink 6% this year as the country plunges into the worst recession in a century. Kevin Hassett, an economist and former CNN contributor who is returning to the Trump administration to help the coronavirus response, said this week that the pandemic could spark a repeat of the Great Depression that began in 1929 and lasted for years. ""We're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that's risky,"" he said. ""Because at some point, we can't not have an economy, right?"" — Julia Horowitz and Matt Egan contributed reporting. ",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/economy/banks-cash-coronavirus/index.html,Do NOT take a bunch of cash out of the bank because of coronavirus,"Bank deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And the FDIC has some helpful guidelines on its website to answer questions consumers may have right now. First and foremost, the FDIC points out that any deposits with a bank will continue to be protected up to at least $250,000. European countries operate similar deposit guarantees, although the maximum insured amounts differ. ""The safest place for your money is inside a bank. Banks will continue to ensure that their customers have access to funds either directly or electronically,"" the FDIC said. The FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve also reminded Americans in a news release Monday that banks are being encouraged to use the Fed's so-called ""discount window"" to take out short-term loans if they need them. The Fed, which is essentially America's bank for the banking system itself, can provide emergency funding to financial institutions in times of crisis. It has also slashed interest rates to zero and dusted off several other financial programs from 2008 to ensure that banks have the funds they need. Big banks are extremely well capitalized But that may not be necessary, especially for the largest banks. The Fed noted in a release on Sunday that big financial institutions have $1.3 trillion in common equity and hold $2.9 trillion in high quality liquid assets on their balance sheets. This means that the top banks have ""substantial levels of capital and liquidity in excess of regulatory minimums and buffers"" according to the Fed. In other words, there is no need for people to take out big lumps of money from their banks. Your deposits are safe.   ""The banking sector is so much better capitalized right now than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. Regulations have only benefited them. Liquidity is there,"" said Matt Daly, head of corporate municipal teams at Conning, an asset management firm. ""This crisis feels a lot different than 2008. That was a true challenge to the plumbing of the financial system. We don't have that now,"" Daly added. Cash may no longer be king in a Venmo world There's another significant difference between now and 2008.  More consumers are using mobile payment apps like Apple Pay, Square Cash, Venmo and PayPal as well as debit cards and credit cards for daily purchases. And many big retailers and smaller merchants are not only accepting these forms of payment; they are actively encouraging their use. This is only expected to continue, especially since there are reports about how physical forms of money could be contaminated by the coronavirus. That decreases the need for people to run to the nearest ATM or bank teller to try and get their hands on as many $20s and $100s that they can. Another good sign? Large banks as well as many smaller regional banks have all agreed to temporarily suspend stock buyback programs in order to ensure that they have the capital they need for loans and other daily operations. Add this all up and it means that people should not fear that banks are running out of cash. There are plenty of other things to be nervous about, but the financial system imploding is not one of them. ""The whole point of the Fed's bazooka fires over the past couple of days is to stabilize the system. The Fed is the lender of last resort,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer with The Bahnsen Group.  ""I don't have any worries about the broader banking system. Access to dollars will not be an issue,"" Bahnsen added.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/business/toilet-paper-supply-chain-coronavirus/index.html,Toilet paper makers: 'What we are dealing with here is uncharted',"Toilet paper has a become the ultimate symbol of the panic buying; it's seemingly scooped up as soon as new rolls hit the shelves. Companies that help supply these everyday paper products are stunned and trying to adjust to this rapidly evolving new normal in consumer behavior. They're faced with tradeoffs. Many were already operating their manufacturing facilities 24/7 prior to the pandemic. Now, some are limiting their facilities to essential workers and contractors. It's unclear, however, what they will do in the event that those workers get sick. ""If you ask me why everyone is grabbing toilet paper, I can't really explain it,"" said Tom Sellars, CEO of Sellars Absorbent Materials in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His company is a processor and converter of paper and related products. ""It's not like we are suddenly using more of it. But the surge in demand could strain the supply chain,"" he said. Georgia Pacific, the maker of Angel Soft and Quilted Northern toilet paper, said that last week, some orders from retailers nearly doubled. The company managed to ship out 20% more than its normal capacity. And the American Forest & Paper Association, an industry group representing paper product makers, noted the industry is working hard to respond to the sudden spike in demand.  ""Rest assured, tissue products continue to be produced and shipped — just as they are 52 weeks each year as part of a global market,"" AF&PA's CEO Heidi Brock said in a statement. But that doesn't mean it will be easy work for the factories. How toilet paper is made Toilet paper is made from one of two sources — virgin pulp from trees or recycled pulp obtained from materials like discarded copy paper that's reprocessed and then turned into pulp.  Virgin pulp comes from Canada and the United States.  The pulp (virgin or recycled) is delivered to paper mills that turn it into large rolls of paper called ""parent rolls"" that are over 100 inches wide. The rolls then arrive at paper-coverting facilities, like the one run by Sellars. ""We purchase large rolls from mills and our equipment cuts and packages them into the designated end product like toilet paper or kitchen towels, depending on the quality of the paper,"" he said. Packaging and shipping are the final steps in the chain. So what happens when there's an unexpected demand spike? ""Most mills are 24 hours, 7 days a week operations already. They are running on fixed capacity,"" said Sellars. ""It's not like there's an idle machine that can be cranked up to increase production."" Retailers also have a set amount of toilet paper inventory. ""What I suspect is happening right now is retailers are tapping into toilet paper inventory that's sitting in their warehouses until they get more shipment from producers,"" he said. For suppliers, rapidly increasing production may not be feasible. So they might instead recalibrate factory production to make more of one type of product and less of another. ""For example, less bathroom paper towels and more toilet paper,"" said Sellars. Consumer products company Kimberly-Clark (KMB), whose retail toilet paper brands include Scott and Cottonelle, said it is taking steps to accelerate production and reallocating inventory to meet current demand. ""We want to assure consumers that we are doing our best to ensure a steady supply of product to stores, and will continue to make adjustments to our plans as necessary,"" the company said in a statement to CNN Business. Another way suppliers are responding to the toilet paper craze: Some are cutting out distribution centers, sending trucks directly to and from paper factories to get product onto shelves more quickly, said Scott Luton, founder and CEO of Supply Chain Now Radio, a digital media company focused on supply chain management. Sahil Tak co-owns ST Paper & Tissue with his father Sharad. The company, in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, operates its own paper mills and makes both parent rolls and finished products like toilet paper and folded bathroom tissues. All of its products are made from recycled paper primarily for commercial customers like hotels, hospitals, schools and offices. Tak calls it the ""away-from-home"" market, and it's been less prone to panic buying than the market for toilet paper people use in their homes. That said, it doesn't mean his businesses hasn't been impacted. Tak said he has been getting calls since last week from toilet paper producers for the home market asking if he has extra supply to share. ""Our supply is tight at the moment. We have over 200 employees running a 24/7 operation. So it's not a question of more staffing to increase production but how to become even more efficient,"" said Tak. His bigger concern, however, is about the health of his employees. ""What we are dealing with here is uncharted,"" said Tak, referring to the fast-spreading pandemic. ""What if facilities have to shut down if workers become sick?"" That's also a pressing concern for Rob Baron, CEO of Marcal Paper. The Elmwood Park, New Jersey company produces and markets its branded paper products, including Marcal toilet paper to both residential and commercial customers. The company just resumed operations in January, a year after a fire destroyed its 80-year-old manufacturing facility. ""Our first step, before we even look at the demand spike, was to think about how to keep our people safe,"" said Baron. ""No visitors, no customers, no suppliers to the facility."" Demand for Marcal toilet paper from retail customers is up over 25%, he said. ""Paper machines already run 24/7. There's only so much we can do with any incremental increase in demand because there is no surplus capacity."" He's making sure Marcal doesn't add on any new customers for now. ""We have to take care of our existing long-term customers and ensure supply to them first,"" he said. Another big worry: stockpiling toilet paper now could eventually hurt manufacturers' sales down the road.  ""We've all seen photos of people carrying shopping carts filled with toilet paper out of stores. They probably won't buy more for three to four months,"" Baron said. ""There will be a demand shock, and it will again strain the system."" — CNN Business' Chauncey Alcorn contributed to this report.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/tech/elon-musk-twitter-coronavirus/index.html,Twitter's coronavirus rules face new test: Elon Musk,"On Thursday, Musk, the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, tweeted the false claim that children are ""essentially immune"" to the virus. Twitter did nothing.  A Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business on Friday that it reviewed Musk's tweet and determined it did not break its rules. Yet, when Twitter unveiled its new rules on Monday, it specifically referenced misinformation about children and the coronavirus as an example of content that would need to be removed. As an example of a tweet that would violate its rules, Twitter had provided the following example: ""COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven't seen any cases of children being sick."" Musk's assertion on Twitter was contradicted at a White House podium on Friday by global health expert Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator. ""To the moms and dads out there that have children with immunodeficiencies or other medical conditions, we don't know the level of risk,"" Birx said. ""There just is not enough numbers at this time to tell them if they are at additional risk or not in the same way that adults are."" Birx, who was speaking generally and not responding to Musk's tweet, added: ""No one is immune. We know it is highly contagious for everyone."" According to a study published online in the medical journal Pediatrics on Monday, children in China infected with novel coronavirus showed less severe symptoms than adults, though infants and toddlers were vulnerable to moderate and severe infection. The study examined 731 confirmed and 1,412 suspected cases of COVID-19 in children. Out of the combined 2,143 cases, one child, a 14-year-old boy, died and nearly 6% of cases were severe, compared with 18.5% of adults experiencing severe symptoms. Young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, the authors of the study said. Nearly 11% of cases were severe and critical for infants less than 1 year old.  Musk previously downplayed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak and kept Tesla's California factory open despite a shelter-in-place order.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/amazon-warehouse-employees-coronavirus/index.html,Amazon warehouse workers fear catching coronavirus just to get you your packages,"While Amazon (AMZN) has taken a number of steps in recent days to protect workers -- including discontinuing stand-up meetings where workers gathered en masse and allowing workers to take unlimited unpaid days off -- several warehouse employees and industry experts told CNN Business they feel the company should be doing more to shield those at the core of its business who can't do their jobs from home. Warehouse workers are petitioning the company to provide paid sick leave regardless of whether someone tests positive for coronavirus, given how difficult it can be to get access to a test. They're asking for facilities to be shut down and for workers to be tested for coronavirus when a positive case is found. In interviews, some raised concerns about pressure to work longer hours, lack of worker screening for possible symptoms, and adequate social distancing measures. ""For me, it creates a lot of anxiety but I have no control. Once I enter that building, I can only do my part,"" said Rina Cummings, a part-time package sorter who works weekends at Amazon's Staten Island, New York, facility. ""Amazon is telling people to wash their hands, but I still notice people aren't doing it. Nobody is really coming around to ask people if they're OK, if they're feeling sick. I feel like they're not as proactive as they should be.""  In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said, ""the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to come to work and serve the people in their communities in a way that very few can—delivering critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them.""  ""We are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,"" the spokesperson added. ""Those who don't want to come to work are welcome to use paid and unpaid time off options and we support them in doing so."" The expectations on Amazon during this crisis are massive. The company announced this week that it is shifting temporarily to prioritize household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into fulfillment centers. And while the S&P 500 has dropped 28% in the last month amid coronavirus concerns, Amazon's stock has gone down just 13%. The pressure is put on its warehouse workers, who were already bearing the brunt of the company's shift to one-day delivery. There is so much need for people to come in amid the pandemic that Amazon announced plans to hire 100,000 more workers in the United States to keep up with demand. The company already counts 400,000 workers across its warehouse facilities in the US. Warehouse workers' concerns gained new urgency this week as an employee at an Amazon facility in Queens, New York, tested positive for coronavirus, the company confirmed to CNN Business. Meanwhile, at least five warehouse workers in Europe tested positive for the virus, the company told CNBC earlier this week. Warehouse workers in Italy also went on strike over the company's coronavirus safety measures. In a statement concerning the quarantined Amazon worker in Queens, an Amazon spokesperson told CNN Business the company is supporting the individual, has temporarily closed its Queens delivery station and sent associates home with full pay.  ""Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with local authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees including increased cleaning at all facilities, maintaining social distance, and adding distance between drivers and customers when making deliveries."" Person-to-person transmission is thought to be the main way that coronavirus is spread. But it is also possible for the virus to be spread through surfaces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to an early study funded by the US National Institutes of Health, the virus can linger on certain surfaces, including cardboard, where it is said to live for up to 24 hours. (Amazon said there is currently no evidence that the virus is being spread through packages, citing the CDC and the World Health Organization.) Adam Diaz, organizing director with Warehouse Worker Resource Center, an advocacy group for warehouse workers in Southern California, said warehouses, some of which have thousands of workers in them, are a ""powder keg"" for the spread of the virus because employees are working side by side for hours at a time. ""There's no room for social distancing. It's close quarters.""  He believes Amazon could institute temperature and symptoms screenings on workers before entering facilities, for example. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued new guidance this week that employers may measure employees' body temperature but warned employers should also be aware some people with coronavirus do not have a fever. The company said workers are told not to come to work if they've had a fever within the last 24 hours, and that Amazon is preparing to do temperature checks if needed. Another employee, who works at the Amazon facility in San Antonio and spoke on the condition of anonymity citing a non-disclosure agreement, said there are ""a lot of people worried"" at the facility. It is ""irresponsible"" for Amazon's warehouses and delivery centers to operate at full capacity given the health concerns, the worker said. ""I think we should be at a lower capacity. I'm concerned for the same reason most others are -- it is about knowing if I will carry it without showing symptoms."" A Tale of Two Amazons At Amazon's offices all over the world, employees have been told to work from home. But inside the company's warehouses, many of these warehouse workers simply can't afford to miss the paychecks. The company has more than 175 fulfillment centers globally, with the majority located in North America and Europe. The company's minimum pay rate is $15 per hour.  Amazon has said it will pay workers who contract coronavirus or are placed into quarantine for up to two weeks. The company is also allowing workers to take unlimited unpaid time off through the end of March. But employees told CNN Business this option alone doesn't help workers who would prefer to stay home because they are concerned about contracting the virus, have family members with compromised immune systems or who don't have childcare options but still need to make money. Instead, many continue to show up to work, hoping they don't contract the virus while packing boxes, gathering in break rooms at meal times, or in locker rooms. Some are picking up extra hours. Some full-time employees are being asked to take on mandatory overtime shifts to help fulfill orders, according to one worker. In a blog post about its new hiring needs, the company said ""our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year.""  Employees told CNN Business the company is also giving the option for workers to claim voluntary extra hours. These include full-day shifts, or 10 extra hours, as well as half days. Workers in the Staten Island facility, for example, are claiming the shifts to work extra hours, according to another worker, despite coronavirus fears. Paid leave, regardless of a positive diagnosis, is just one of the demands listed across two different petitions that have surfaced this week, each signed by more than 1,500 people. (One of the petitions specifies it is for Amazon workers and asks workers to include their first name, job title and location; the other allows for anyone to sign.) Another suggestion is time-and-a-half ""hazard pay"" for those willing and able to risk working on-location. (The company said earlier this week it will increase pay for workers by $2 per hour through April.) Eating lunch in the car  Amazon fulfillment centers have been scrutinized in the past for worker safety issues. There have been numerous reports over the years of its warehouse employees complaining about difficult working conditions. The rate of serious injuries in some fulfillment centers is high, as is the turnover rate. (Amazon has previously defended its safety record.) As the coronavirus outbreak worsens, Amazon has taken some steps to protect its workforce. Signs in dining locations inside one facility company tell workers to ""maintain minimum 3 feet of distance"" at lunch tables, according to a photograph taken by a worker and shared with CNN Business. The company has temporarily suspended security checks upon leaving facilities, citing the recommended social distancing of approximately three feet, workers said. While those measures comply with the ""social distancing"" guidelines by the World Health Organization, that may not be sufficient during the coronavirus pandemic. The CDC is calling for people to stay six feet apart and not maintain ""close contact."" Workers also said hand sanitizer is typically available and that people already tend to wear gloves. Workers can retrieve gloves out of the vending machines in warehouses, where workers can access items free-of-charge by swiping their work badges. Two employees, each at a different facility, told CNN Business that vending machines limit the number of gloves they can get per week to one or two pairs. One of the employees said if their gloves became contaminated within the week, they have asked a supervisor for use of their badge to get a new pair of gloves from the machine. Amazon denies there are any limits on the amount of gloves workers can take. A spokesperson said the company would look into the matter. The company said that it has also spread out tables in break rooms and shifted start times and break times to further promote social distancing. Still, some are resorting to taking their own preventative measures, such as eating meals in the parking lot and trying to be careful when in the locker area, where workers are asked to store loose items.  As a packer at the company's Staten Island facility, who asked to be anonymous for fear of retribution, put it: To wade through all the people in the locker area, ""you have to walk sideways.""",3/21/2020

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/media/fox-news-white-house-coronavirus-doctors/index.html,How the Fox News presidency has politicized a national health crisis,"As the coronavirus crisis deepens all across the United States, the Trump administration is favoring Fox and turning down almost all other networks' interview requests. It's the politicization of a pandemic. The result: Key administration officials are not being subjected to much-needed scrutiny. And doctors are being drawn into a petty political game. Fox, the television home of the Trump administration, has been stocked with Trump aides and officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who appeared on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Tuesday night and said President Trump's insistence on a return to normalcy ""by Easter"" is just an ""aspirational goal."" By showing up on Fox and shunning other networks, top officials may be trying to get through to Trump -- or doing what they perceive he wants. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" Wednesday morning and criticized the press. She said some unnamed ""members of the media are using a really important time in our country to try and divide people on the task force."" Grisham is a regular on Fox, but almost never agrees to interviews on broadcast networks, which draw more viewers than Fox. Booking producers have been getting frustrated by all the ""no's"" from the administration. Clashes within the White House's communications team have exacerbated the problems. ""There are some people on the task force who actually want to do TV but can't get any straight answers from the White House or the Vice President's communications shop, so interviews are falling through the cracks left and right,"" a television producer with knowledge of the matter said. The coronavirus task force was formed in late January as a response to the outbreak in the US. It is composed of White House officials and doctors, including Dr. Fauci, Surgeon General Jerome Adams and Dr. Deborah Birx. The task force's TV appearances suggest a shoring-up-the-base strategy by the White House -- which is incongruent while the entire country is fighting a virus that has no political party. No government officials appeared on Wednesday's TV morning newscasts, for example. But Surgeon General  Adams made time for Sean Hannity's talk show on Tuesday night. According to Hannity, he will be interviewing Trump later this week. Fox programs have soft-pedaled the government's shortcomings and promoted an imminent rollback of social distancing restrictions. Public health experts say such a change could be catastrophic because it would cause a surge in new coronavirus infections. But Trump was barely challenged on that point when Fox anchors interviewed him on Tuesday. The interview was billed as a ""virtual town hall"" live from the Rose Garden. It took place in the early afternoon, typically one of the lowest-rated times of day on Fox News, instead of prime time. (Ratings have been elevated across the board due to the national emergency.) ""I doubt this would ever happen, but Trump should hold a town hall with another network in the very near future,"" Poynter senior media writer Tom Jones wrote Wednesday. Throughout the duration of the coronavirus crisis, Trump has appeared at regular White House briefings, and has attracted criticism for spreading misinformation from the podium. He has given interviews to Fox but has declined virtually all other interview requests. Dr. Fauci has been much more available for interviews. His presence at some briefings, and his absence at others, has stirred speculation about his relationship with the president. Fauci appeared on CNN's weekly global coronavirus town hall for the past three weeks, but the administration initially declined to make him available for this Thursday's town hall, according to a CNN representative. After this story was originally published on Wednesday, Fauci was added as a confirmed guest for the town hall. He is also expected to appear on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" on Wednesday night.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/business/subscription-box-services-trend/index.html,Do you really need new clothes every month? Subscription box novelty has worn off,"There's makeup, all kinds of food -- fresh meats, pet meals, ugly food (like dented but otherwise good-to-eat fruits and vegetables) -- clothes, toothbrushes, socks and even birth control.  Why even bother stepping into a store anymore? It's a godsend for harried consumers or just bored, lazy ones. Industry watchers estimate that there are anywhere from 3,500 to 5,000 different subscription box services competing for consumers'  dollars, according to the Subscription Trade Association. With so many subscription services flooding the market, is this a sustainable new business model or will there be some necessary culling of the fat? ""I think we are seeing the trend peaking in terms of new subscription startups rapidly coming to market,"" said Christopher George, chairman and founder of the Subscription Trade Association. ""Another potential problem for small subscription box upstarts: established retail brands like Nike and Walmart have also started playing in the space by launching their own direct-to-consumer subscription services. ""The challenge to these [box] services now becomes how to attract new customers while also retaining their existing customers as competition increases,"" said Barb Renner, US consumer products leader with Deloitte. For most, success has been hard to come by The subscription box model is simple: Subscribers pay a fee for signing up. In return they're promised a package in the mail, usually every month. It can be a ""surprise"" mix of new items -- what George calls a  ""discover and delight"" type service, like Birchbox. Birchbox sends a monthly curated box of beauty samples to its subscribers. Even though subscription services, per se, have existed for years (think cable subscriptions and Columbia House's mail order for records and CD in the 1990s), George said Birchbox is widely credited for evolving the concept and popularizing the surprise aspect of it.  The other model offers a personalized collection of products based on consumers' individual preferences, for less than what they would cost in stores.  ""This is more of a [product] replenishment service like Dollar Shave Club,"" he said.  Dollar Shave Club, a monthly razor subscription service for men, was acquired by Unilever in 2016, five years after it launched, for a reported $1 billion. Two years later, Proctor & Gamble bought women's subscription razor startup Billie.  But the reality for most other box services hasn't been as rosy. Dollar Shave Club and Billie represent just two percent of shop-in-a-box startups that have either been acquired or have gone public in the last decade, like Blue Apron and Stitch Fix (a personalized clothing service.) As many as 80% of subscription startups face financial difficulties, said Renner, citing industry reports. And only a dozen or so have raised private equity growth deals for expanding the business in the last 10 years, according to research firm Pitchbook. Food in a box is a tough sell Blue Apron is a glaring example of what can go wrong with these services.  It was one of the buzziest meal-kit subscription startups when it launched in 2012. Then the company went public in 2017 to became one of the worst-performing IPOs that year. And its stock continues to struggle. Just this month, Blue Apron reported a quarterly loss and said it was ""evaluating a broad range of strategic options"" that could include a sale of the company or its assets, a business combination or raising capital. Subscription boxes containing perishable items, like food, can be tricky, said George. It's why meal-kit services are seeing a lot of customer churn. ""With non-perishable products like makeup, you can at least store them if you have too many already, and then you get another new box,"" said George. That's not the case with food. ""This leads to waste and consumers don't want that,"" he said.  So services have to be very flexible by offering consumers the option to pause their service or change the delivery frequency as and when they need to. Blue Apron does allow both options but many other similar services don't. The other issue is the novelty factor wearing off in a crowded competitive space.  The fairly low barrier to entry to start a service service means Blue Apron has many competitors. Since meal habits can be fickle, this doesn't bode well for long-term customer retention, said George. Meanwhile, the cost of customer acquisition and retention remain very high, said Deloitte's Renner. ""Right now, an average customer stays with a service for about 6 months. And there is no penalty on them for leaving,"" she said. Renner said companies will be constantly challenged to find ways to hold on subscribers.  Still more room to grow The market size for subscription box services is estimated to be as big as $15 billion, said Ken Fenyo, an industry specialist with Fuel, a division of McKinsey. ""Some of the early hype seems to have worn off. With that, the focus has now shifted to how these subscription ecommerce services can build sustainable business,"" said Fenyo, who believes there's still room to grow. ""We're still seeing new concepts emerging,"" he said. Among them, personal care and oral care products are a hot growth area, he said.  Another is clothing rental services, such as Rent the Runway Unlimited, which seem to be hitting the right notes on sustainability, a top priority with millennials. Investors haven't given up, though. Venture capital deals for subscription box companies grew robustly from 2010 to 2014 when private investors poured nearly $993 million into these startups. The peak was in 2014 when total deals hit $663 million.  Since then, the momentum has slightly slowed to a total of $562 million in 2019. But it's still sizable. Pitchbook derived the data by specifically looking at subscription box companies that had completed a founding round, were acquired or went public in the last 10 years. Even with thousands of these services in existence, Fenyo said awareness about them is ""still pretty low."" This means there are millions more consumers yet to sign on. ""Our most recent research from 2018 showed that 50% of consumers know one of the major services,"" he said. All this still bodes well for the industry going forward. ""People don't necessarily have an inherent love of subscription services. They are generally looking for a great experience and product,"" said Fenyo. ""The companies that get this right will gain traction."" Birchbox founder Katia Beauchamp agreed. ""There is a huge opportunity in the subscription space to reach consumers in a way that other retail models haven't been able to,"" she said. ""There are millions of consumers who have never experienced an experience designed for their needs, and we have only tapped the tip of the iceberg. Ten years in, we are still seeing growth and momentum."" And more competition, she said, isn't necessarily a bad thing.  ""Seeing other brands enter the subscription space validates what we've known for a decade - subscriptions can provide a valuable way for consumers to discover products and categories,"" said Beauchamp.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/tech/flipkart-amazon-india-coronavirus/index.html,Flipkart shuts down and Amazon limits orders for 1.3 billion Indians under lockdown,"Flipkart, which is owned by Walmart (WMT), announced Wednesday that it was suspending services after authorities called for a ""complete"" lockdown for the entire population of 1.3 billion people, directing most stores, offices and factories to shut down.  ""We urge you to stay at home to be safe,"" Flipkart said in a statement. ""Our promise is that we will be back to serve you as soon as possible."" People around the world have been relying more on online shopping in an effort to limit physical contact as the virus spreads. Amazon (AMZN) has revealed plans to hire 100,000 distribution workers in the United States, while Chinese firm JD.com (JD) has pledged to open up more than 20,000 new positions.  Amazon, Flipkart's main rival in India, on Tuesday moved to limit orders as it responded to increased demand because of the coronavirus outbreak. It said in a blog post that it would ""temporarily stop taking orders"" for some items as workers focus on filling orders for ""critical"" goods, such as household staples, packaged food and hygiene products. ""To serve our customers' most urgent needs while also ensuring safety of our associates, we are prioritizing (with immediate effect) all our resources to serve products that are currently high priority,"" Amit Agarwal, head of Amazon India, said in a statement.  Customers who already placed orders for products that don't meet that criteria will be contacted and offered a refund, the company added.  The Indian government has stipulated that only services deemed ""essential"" to public life should stay up and running. That includes the delivery of food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment provided by e-commerce companies. But some businesses are hinting at confusion on the ground. Flipkart, for instance, did not say why it shuttered operations when, as an e-commerce firm, it appeared to be exempt from the restrictions. The company is reviewing ""the possibilities of operating in the lockdown,"" chief corporate affairs officer Rajneesh Kumar told CNN Business. ""We are prioritizing the safety of our delivery executives and seeking the support of the local governments and police authorities to meet the needs of our customers,"" he said in a statement, without elaborating further. Amazon told CNN Business it was ""working with the central government and local authorities, asking them to help us urgently with detailed on-ground operating procedures."" Mixed messages Zomato, a popular food delivery startup, said its delivery workers were ""facing several hurdles across cities while trying to deliver food."" It pointed out that its work had been classified as an essential service, but said that ""coordinating with multiple local authorities is ... challenging."" ""The government has provided strong guidance which we are adhering by and trying our best to execute on the ground,"" a company spokesperson told CNN Business. ""We are communicating with the relevant authorities and hoping these issues are sorted soon."" At least some confusion appears to stem from warehouse closures. The online supermarket Grofers said Tuesday on Twitter that its warehouse in the northern city of Faridabad had been closed by local law enforcement, and that it was facing ""operational challenges due to a lack of clarity in our listing as an essential service provider."" K K Rao, commissioner of police in Faridabad, told CNN Business that while they are not stopping e-commerce services, they are briefing factory workers about social distancing requirements. He said that meant some factories were ""temporarily shut by the police in order to brief employees."" — Esha Mitra contributed to this report.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/business/coronavirus-work-from-home-casual-dress-code-trnd/index.html,"When you work from home, every day is (very) casual Friday","How disheveled do you look when you're working from home? Do you stay in your pajamas all day? Do you even shower? Or are you one of those people who insists on looking your office-best even while pecking away at your keyboard at home? As officials try to control the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of white collar workers — normally bound by dress codes and expectations in the office — are trading business trousers for sweat pants, and stiff blazers for that hoodie they would only ever allow their family, roommates or dog to see.   For some work-from-homers, comfort-first attire is a source of shame — a symptom of broken routines and under-motivation. For others, it's ultimate liberation. After all, fashion in general has become increasingly casual over the past few decades. These days, activewear or ""athleisure"" is customary weekend wear, even outside the gym.  Plus, formal work environments have become the exception, not the rule — a trend often blamed on millennials in tech startups. Even notoriously buttoned-up Goldman Sachs is adopting a more 'flexible' dress code.  But even in a casual work environment, there's a limit. When going to a job interview, 65% of Americans feel it's important to wear a suit, regardless of how formal the company's dress code is, according to a 2019 survey by Ranstad US. In the same survey, 50% of respondents say they wear business attire from the waist up and casual clothing from the waist down when they have a video interview. So, given the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, is it unhealthy for people working from home to just wake up and stumble over to the computer screen in their pajamas?   ""If that works for us and we can be in that place to put our energy into work the way it needs to be — to do the job — there's nothing wrong with that at all,"" Atlanta-based psychologist Erik Fisher told CNN. On the other hand, the CDC has told people it's important to keep up their routines to ease anxiety during the pandemic. ""It's all about mental preparation,"" Fisher said. ""If this helps somebody to mentally prepare and to go through that habit (of getting dressed), and that's the habit and the structure they've created for themselves, don't change that."" Researchers have long been fascinated with the meaning behind clothing, not only as a way for people to communicate with others, but as a way to shape one's own perception of oneself. One 2015 study found that people who dress up tend to think more creatively. But that just depends on the individual. ""If you pay attention to staying disciplined, showering as soon as you get up, eating a good breakfast, putting on clothes that make you feel good, you're going to have a good day,"" said Joey Schweitzer, the founder of the successful motivational YouTube channel Better Ideas and who works from his home near Vancouver, Canada. ""You're going to pay more attention to the work that you're doing, and you're going to feel like a functioning member of society."" Some employees fortunate enough to work remotely are even trading casual Fridays for fancy Fridays, donning cocktail or black tie. ""It's nice to build a sense of community and create a reason to make a work day special during such uncertainty,"" said Laura Anne Cotney, who works with a real estate software company in Athens, Georgia. Fisher recommended that if a person is working from home in his or her pajamas and feels like they ""should"" be dressing up, they need to look at where that inner voice is coming from. ""When people feel judged, they often go back to a place of shame and guilt and inadequacy, and that's why I think we have to be able to be our own self-observers,"" Fisher told CNN. ""In other words, we're looking for the ""right"" way to do things,"" Fisher said. ""And if it's not the right way, then it must be wrong, and if it's not the good way, it must be bad.  And if it's not the strong way, it must be weak. So, ask yourself, where does that voice come from? And then be able to stop and tell yourself, it's my own internal place of comfort and peace that will find my ability to succeed, not how I look on the outside.""",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/business/walmart-kroger-changes-coronavirus-wellness/index.html,"Walmart, Albertsons, Kroger and Whole Foods are adding sneeze guards to checkout lanes","Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons are installing plexiglass sneeze guards in the coming weeks to help protect their employees from the spread of coronavirus as they continue to work on the front lines of a public health pandemic.  It's part of a growing number of changes the companies are implementing as they continue to remain open, including enforcing social distancing guidelines. Walmart Walmart (WMT), which is America's largest grocer, is adding the sneeze guards at its 4,700 US stores and at its 600 Sam's Club locations within the next three weeks. It's also adding floor decals at the checkout lines reminding people of the six-foot social distancing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control.  The company said it also found a ""new solution"" for sanitizing shopping carts: a new backpack-style sprayer employees use to clean the carts ""quicker and more thoroughly.""  Walmart employees will also have free access to telehealth doctor appointments. The copay is normally $4 per appointment. Walmart is also giving most of its employees extended ability to use a new financial services app that lets them receive early access some of their earned wages. The company announced last week it was shortening its store hours because of the demand for necessities during the coronavirus pandemic. It is also opening its stores one hour early on Tuesdays to seniors only, through April 28. Albertsons Albertsons, which owns a number of grocery store brands across the US including Safeway and Vons, said it's installing the sneeze guards at all of its 2,200 stores within the next two weeks. It's also adding posters and floor decals at areas where people frequently wait including at the pharmacy, at check-out lines and the deli.  Albertsons is suspending its self-serve bars used for wings and soups, adding special shopping hours for senior citizens and implementing more frequent cleaning of its stores and shopping carts. Kroger Kroger (KR) is making similar changes, including installing sneeze guards and floor decals about social distancing at its 2,700 US stores in the coming weeks.  It's also letting employees wear protective masks and gloves. The company also owns Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter and Ralphs grocery store brands.  Target Social distancing signs and floor decals are also being added at Target (TGT). The company announced Wednesday its check-out lanes will be cleaned after each transaction, and only some aisles will be open at a given time so the closed lanes can be deep cleaned. Target is also ceasing in-store returns and exchanges for the next three weeks to reduce the number of items its employees are touching. Return dates will be extended for those affected by the sudden policy change. Target is also suspending sales of reusable bags, so it will waive the fees usually charged in some locales for plastic and paper bags. Whole Foods Whole Foods stores are also installing sneeze guards to protect customers and employees. The company said it is in the process of rolling out the barriers to all locations.  The company has adjusted its hours and expanded employee benefits during the outbreak.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/business/rothys-bags/index.html,Rothy's has new idea for ocean plastic waste: handbags,"On Monday, the company announced it is expanding beyond just plastic bottles to tackle the next challenge -- plastic waste in the oceans. Roth Martin, who launched his company in San Francisco in 2012, said Rothy's was launching a new product category -- handbags -- made with the same knitting technology, but the yarn for the bags is a blend of its water-bottle yarn and recycled plastic collected within 30 miles of coastlines and marine environments.  ""This expansion into handbags is a natural progression of our strategy to make sustainable products with environmentally-responsible manufacturing,"" said Martin.  Like its shoes, the handbags (priced from $65 to $350) are also machine washable and feature five styles that include a tote, crossbody and a pouch.  Each bag is knit to shape, a proprietary process the company has developed to leave minimal waste on the factory floor, said Martin. This is unlike traditional traditional handbag manufacturing that involves taking a pattern and cutting out the panels out of one sheet of fabric and then assembling it. ""We have essentially designed our machines and our entire manufacturing process around using post-consumer waste,"" said Martin.  ""We can lead by example""  Rothy's knitting technology, which it calls ""3D-knitting,"" has been around for a while, but it was mostly used for making garments. Rothy's took that technology and adapted it to shoe manufacturing.  The 3D-knit machines in the factory are programmed to make precise sizes and knit the upper shell of the shoe in a single process.  ""This is why our shoes don't have any seams,"" said Martin. This technique also helps reduce waste by eliminating the need to cut excess yarn and fabric. ""And having no seams, we think, makes them more comfortable."" Unlike competitors' 3D-knitted shoes, such as Nike's Flyprint shoes, Rothy's have no laces. That presented a challenge. But customers seem pleased with the fit: The eco-friendly shoe brand doesn't disclose overall shoe sales but said it sold one million pairs in 2018 alone, all made from repurposed discarded water bottles.  Sustainability The sustainable appeal of the machine-washable shoes (which cost $125 to $165 ranging from flats and loafers to sneakers) is also tailor made for social media hype, where on Instagram the brand has 306,000 followers. Among the brand's celebrity fans is Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, who wore them during a trip to Australia in 2018 and to Africa in October.  ""We've recycled more than 50 million plastic water bottles for our shoes to date. By making our thread from plastic bottles, we keep them out of landfills,"" said Martin. Rothy's owns and operates its own ""sustainable factory' in  China where each shoe goes through dozens of steps before the finished product is put into a recycled cardboard shoebox. Given that all of Rothy's production is in China, Martin is closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak there. He noted his factory was back in production in mid- February. ""But logistics could still be a problem because there is pent-up demand to get goods out of China,"" he said. The factory itself, which employs 1,000 people, is a 'no waste"" operation, he said.  ""We recycle everything, whatever falls on the floor and whatever our employees bring in,"" said Martin. ""I grew up in San Francisco. Recycling was at the forefront of thinking all around me. It's why I want to make goods in a responsible way."" That message seems to be resonating with consumers. According to social media analytics firm Social Standards, which looked at millions of Instagram posts in February, customers most associate Rothy's with themes like sustainability and comfort in their social conversations about the brand. Martin says the business is profitable and wants to keep Rothy's primarily a direct-to-consumer brand. But the company has opened a few stores,  one each in Boston, San Francisco and in Washington.   ""In some aspects, Rothy's was one of the first companies to embrace sustainability as a mission from the beginning,"" said Beth Goldsetin, footwear and accessories analyst with market research firm NPD.  She said Rothy's has become synonymous with sustainability, giving it a leg up over other big brands that were slower to embrace that mission. ""We want to lead by example and influence others on responsible manufacturing,"" said Martin.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/business/essential-businesses-states-coronavirus-trnd/index.html,What constitutes 'essential businesses'? States seem to have varying standards,"The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted at least 17 states to issue stay-at-home orders. As a result, some businesses are shuttering while the ""essential"" ones remain open, though often with restrictions.  The lists of essential businesses are mostly the same: Health care services, grocery stores and gas stations make the cut. Malls, gyms and movie theaters do not.  But a closer look at state orders shows some inconsistencies: In Delaware, florists can still deliver bouquets. In Pennsylvania, medical marijuana dispensaries are OK but liquor stores aren't. And in Arizona, golf courses can stay open, too -- they're essential businesses.  The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) gave states an outline of suggested ""essential businesses"" to follow.  But because it's up to the states, there are bound to be differences among them -- and many lists are shifting as the pandemic does. Liquor stores Liquor stores are considered essential businesses in every state that's issued stay-at-home orders but one -- Pennsylvania.  That could pose a major risk to substance-dependent people, said Bill Stauffer, substance use disorder counselor and executive director of the Pennsylvania Recovery Organizations Alliance.  ""We know that there's a large portion of population with alcohol dependence, and a large portion of those who are at risk of physical withdrawal,"" he told CNN. ""Some of them don't even know they're alcohol dependent -- it's one of the most life-threatening types of withdrawal.""  The sudden shutdown caused sales to soar in Pennsylvania. On March 16, the same day the state announced all liquor stores would shutter by 9 p.m. the next day, there was almost $30 million in sales across nearly 600 liquor stores -- perhaps the highest-earning day recorded, according to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.  Gov. Tom Wolf said he's reconsidering the ban based on concerns from industry groups and Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs.   But there are concerns, in Pennsylvania and in states where liquor stores are open, that climbing rates of unemployment and pandemic-induced stress could drive more people to the liquor store than usual. That's why keeping mental health and substance abuse services open and available is essential, Stauffer said.  Substance use disorder recovery groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous are moving online and mental health counselors are conducting appointments over video, but those methods aren't always effective for substance-dependent people who are detoxing, he said. ""Addressing people's substance use and mental health needs are critical components of us resolving this,"" Stauffer said. ""Without that, it's going to be a whole lot worse."" Gun stores Firearm retailers aren't specifically mentioned in most states' lists of non-essential businesses, so they're assumed to be non-essential. But in many cities within those states, the mandates aren't being enforced, so they're staying open anyway.  Take California. Because firearms dealers aren't explicitly outlined in the CISA guidance, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said, they'll be allowed to remain open in the county.  Gun stores provide a ""valuable public service,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement, and closing them could drive illegal firearms sales. But things are different 120 miles away in Los Angeles, where police on Tuesday added 1,300 deputies to crack down on gun stores that stayed open despite Gov. Gavin Newson's stay-at-home order.  When firearms didn't make Pennsylvania's list of essential businesses, locals flooded state gun stores to stock up before they shut indefinitely. The governor later updated the state's list of ""life-sustaining businesses"" to include gun stores -- but with some limitations. Under the new order, firearms dealers must operate under limited hours on an individual appointment basis to comply with social distancing measures.  And in states where orders for gun stores aren't concrete, buyers are eagerly stocking up on ammunition before they're closed indefinitely. It's a symptom of uncertain times, industry analyst Rob Southwick told CNN last week. People buy firearms to feel safer.  Marijuana dispensaries Most states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana have allowed dispensaries to remain open. Advocates say the substances can be life-sustaining for millions of patients.  Many people rely on medical cannabis to alleviate seizures, chemotherapy-induced nausea and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, a cannabis legalization organization, in an open letter to state governors. ""Cannabis is a crucial part of the treatment regimens of hundreds of thousands of individuals, including many who have vulnerable immune systems because of their advanced age or a serious medical condition,"" the organization's letter read. ""For these individuals, the uncertainty created by the crisis we face is compounded by the prospect of losing access to a treatment option that is essential to their well-being."" Pennsylvania considers medical marijuana growers and dispensaries ""life-sustaining"" businesses. California and Washington state orders don't specify the difference between medical and recreational dispensaries -- only that ""cannabis retailers"" can remain open.  Abortion providers Physicians in every state have called on residents to cancel all non-essential appointments and elective procedures to avoid burdening the health care system.  In Texas and Ohio, two states that have moved to restrict abortion access before the pandemic, abortions may be considered non-essential.  Ohio Deputy Attorney General Jonathan Fulkerson sent letters to three abortion providers and asked them to halt all ""non-essential abortions."" He said abortions considered non-essential are ""those those that can be delayed without undue risk to the current or future health of a patient."" Texas lawmakers didn't make a distinction. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed that abortion was included in Gov. Greg Abbott's order that health care providers ""postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient."" Providers that violate the order ""will be met with the full force of the law,"" Paxton said in a statement. Violations could land providers with $1,000 fines or up to 180 days in prison.  Florists, golf courses and Staples? States have made some unexpected additions to their ""essential"" businesses lists.  In Delaware, florists can still make deliveries, for one.  ""We felt like they could operate much like restaurants under those restrictions -- that they could perform delivery services,"" Delaware's Division of Small Businesses director Damian DeStefano told radio station WDEL. ""They're also needed for certain essential events from time to time."" And while Arizona's national parks are closed, many golf courses in the state aren't.  Matt Barr, general manager of the We-Ko-Pa course on the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation reservation, said the course will remain open with limited cafe service, one of Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's provisions for staying open.   ""We thought -- and we still do -- that playing golf while exercising caution and sensitivity to everyone around you, remains a viable outdoor activity,"" Barr said, according to The Arizona Republic.  Big box retailers are obligated to stay open. But most states are allowing office supply stores and hardware retailers to stay open, too -- think Staples and Ace Hardware -- because they sell supplies to help transition employees to work from home.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/business/states-grocery-workers-emergency-trnd/index.html,Minnesota and Vermont will classify grocery store employees as emergency workers,"In addition to health care workers and first responders, the people on the front lines of the pandemic include grocery store employees: the clerks who operate the registers, the staff who stock the shelves, the people who work in distribution and the workers who keep the stores clean. Now some states are classifying grocery store workers as emergency employees, making them eligible for certain benefits, in news first reported by Mother Jones. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz issued an executive order over the weekend that provides childcare for school-age children of emergency workers, which now encompasses grocery store employees.  The guidance following the order classifies ""food distribution workers"" as essential tier 2 employees for whom districts should provide child care. ""Care for children of educators, gas and electric utility workers, food distribution personnel, water treatment staff, and others outlined below is essential to ensuring the public continues to receive these vital services,"" the executive order reads. ""Districts should make every effort to provide care for school-age children of workers in the areas below, if they are able to do so while adhering to the Minnesota Department of Health's social distancing guidelines."" The Minnesota Grocers Association, a trade group that represents the state's food industry, applauded the move.  "".@GovTimWalz has classified ""food distribution workers,"" which is store clerks, stockers, etc, as Tier 2 emergency works. This allows frontline workers childcare as they serve and feed Minnesotans. Thank you @GovTimWalz for supporting our industry during this challenging time!"" the organization tweeted. Vermont has indicated it would do the same. Gov. Phil Scott issued a directive earlier this week that encouraged childcare centers to stay open where needed to provide services for the state's emergency workers, which includes health care workers, criminal justice personnel, first responders, public health employees, National Guard workers and some state employees.  Currently, the guidance does not specifically define food workers as emergency personnel, though it indicates that the definition of essential employees could evolve as the state continues to respond to the crisis. But at a press conference on Wednesday, state public safety commissioner Michael Schirling said that grocery store workers and others who work in food distribution are considered essential and that he expected them to be added to the list of emergency workers soon.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/business/economy-recession-coronavirus-trump-easter/index.html,Trump wants America reopened by Easter. That could send the US economy into depression,"Trump said Tuesday he wants the United States ""opened up and raring to go by Easter.""   The goal would be to ease the debilitating financial pain caused by the unprecedented shutdown of large swaths of the nation's economy. Unemployment claims are spiking. The stock market has cratered. And gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the economy -- will probably suffer an historic collapse.   But there are massive risks involved with quickly reversing the social distancing policies. Not only would a premature re-opening of the economy defy the advice of health experts, but economists warn it would backfire. Instead of a one-time blow, the economy could face repeated shutdowns over a prolonged period.   ""If the president decides to go 180 on us and open by Easter, that will create chaos and confusion. That is the prescription for a depression,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNN Business.   The goal of the health restrictions is to slow the outbreak, buying precious time to prevent the nation's hospitals and doctors from becoming completely overwhelmed.   ""If people are panicked because hospitals are overflowing and loved ones are dying, the hit to the economy will be even worse than if we remain in lockdown,"" said Zandi, who advised Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008. ""It's a massive gamble -- and one without science on his side.""  Bernanke warns against rushing back to work Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman credited with rescuing the American economy from the 2008 crisis, issued a similar warning Wednesday.  ""It's important that before we put everyone back to work, we have the public health situation under control,"" Bernanke said on CNBC.   Bernanke, who studied the Great Depression, said the current situation is ""more like a major snowstorm or natural disaster than a Great Depression-style downturn.""  But in this case, it's a snowstorm being intentionally brought on by governments desperately trying to prevent the spread of the virus.   Almost half of all Americans have been ordered to stay home. Malls and shopping centers are empty. Airports are vacant. Roads and bridges are eerily quiet. Restaurants have converted to takeout only.   ""We're at a Volcker moment,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, referring to former Fed chief Paul Volcker's painful decision in the late 1970 and early 1980s to put the United States into a recession to tame runaway inflation.  ""The federal government is slowing the economy down to try to terminate the virus. It's a conscious policy choice,"" Brusuelas said.  Morgan Stanley: Unemployment could spike to 12% Conscious or not, the pain is severe for both Wall Street and Main Street.  Unemployment benefits spiked 33% last week, the sharpest increase since 1992. Goldman Sachs predicted that figure will spike eightfold this week to a record 2.25 million.  The US unemployment rate will climb rapidly from current levels of 3.5%. Morgan Stanley sees unemployment averaging a record 12.8% in the second quarter.   And economists are bracing for an historic collapse in GDP. Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will contract at a 24% annualized rate in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley sees a record-breaking drop of 30.1%.   Sniffing out the looming recession, the stock market has gotten crushed. The S&P 500 has lost a quarter of its value, ending the longest bull market in American history.   Washington wasted little time mounting a powerful response.  The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero, promised to buy an unlimited amount of bonds (infinite QE) and is working overtime to unfreeze the financial pipelines in a bid to prevent a financial crisis.  Congress and the White House reached a deal on a $2 trillion economic stimulus package early Wednesday that provides relief for households, small businesses and lifelines for major corporations.   Blankfein supports phased return to work But the stimulus won't erase the economic fallout. Moody's still expects second-quarter GDP to plunge by 17.6%, compared with 28.3% without stimulus.   Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that efforts to flatten the virus curve are ""sensible,"" but have a real cost, too.  ""Crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue - and beyond,"" Blankfein tweeted on Tuesday. ""Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.""  Zandi urged US officials to study what happened in Asia, where China, South Korea and Singapore imposed very restrictive lockdowns.   ""They're on the other side of this. While they are still battling the virus, their economies are coming back to life,"" Zandi said.   Yet Beijing is also discovering that it is difficult to persuade companies to get back to normal. And there is a risk that rushing that return to normalcy could spark a second wave of coronavirus in China.   Better off with one-time hit With the presidential election barely five months away, Trump is clearly getting anxious to lift the health restrictions and revive the economy.   ""Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly,"" the president tweeted on Tuesday. ""THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!""  Of course, Trump would not be able to singlehandedly bring the economy back to life.  Various mayors and governors would likely keep their shutdowns in place, especially in hard-hit areas such as New York, New Jersey and San Francisco. And countless CEOs would chart their own course, keeping their offices and factories dark to protect workers and morale.   Still, lifting federal restrictions would re-open parts of the economy, despite pleas from health officials not to do so.  ""One can't help but think this is just a naked expression of the president's own narrow electoral interests,"" RSM's Brusuelas said.   But Brusuelas urged Trump to put the national interests ahead of his own political ambitions.  ""If you reopen the economy prior to the termination of the virus, you're creating a better probability of second and third waves that shut the economy again,"" he said. ""The US is better off taking a one-time hit.""",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/tech/youtube-video-quality-coronavirus/index.html,YouTube to reduce video quality worldwide to ease strain on internet networks,"The move is aimed at easing the burden on internet infrastructure as lockdowns and other emergency policies have kept millions at home. The global change, which was announced and began rolling out on Tuesday, is expected to last for approximately 30 days as millions of people around the globe stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In a statement, YouTube said the move is meant ""to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.""  Users will still be able to manually change to a higher resolution on a per-video basis, YouTube told CNN. YouTube and Netflix previously said they would reduce streaming quality in Europe for a limited time to prevent the internet collapsing under the strain of unprecedented usage due to the coronavirus pandemic. Due to more people working and studying from home, the internet's underlying infrastructure is expected to face ""an enormous stress test,"" industry analysts have told CNN. Even some of the biggest tech platforms are now grappling with a greater challenge in keeping their services up and running amid surging demand. Last week, Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters that the company's platforms are facing ""big surges"" in engagement, with traffic patterns exceeding what the company ordinarily sees around the New Year's holiday. On Tuesday, Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said there is ""a lot of usage, a lot of demand"" on the service. During an Instagram livestream, Mosseri added that a new feature on Instagram dedicated to showing what users are doing from home — titled Stay Home — was so popular it ""almost took down Instagram"" in its opening hours.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/business/adidas-beyonce/index.html,Adidas and Beyoncé will release more Ivy Park gear this year,"The Grammy Award-winning singer signed a contract with Adidas last year, joining the ranks of Pharrell Williams and Kanye West to become the latest celeb to partner with the sportswear maker known for its signature three stripes logo. Speaking to investors and analysts at Adidas's financial results conference on Wednesday, Rorsted confirmed Beyoncé's Ivy Park gear sold out ""immediately"" following its surprise January release online. ""Whether its footwear or apparel, we'll continue to do launches throughout this year in both categories where Beyoncé will bring her inspiration, her creativity and her brand to the unique brand of Adidas,"" Rorsted said. Queen Bey found creative ways to build demand for her Adidas line, posting cryptic photos of company's logo and a release debate on her Instagram page to tease the brand's launch in the weeks before its planned January 18 release date. When the line dropped a day earlier than anticipated, Ms. Knowles-Carter's famously devout fans -- fondly referred to as the Beyhive - tweeted relentlessly about the maroon and orange gear, making the brand a trending topic on Twitter. Rorsted also described Beyoncé as ""probably the most influential female entertainer in the world today"" on Wednesday, noting that a big part of Adidas's 2020 focus will be the ""female consumer."" ""Jointly, we will create products that are attractive to consumers around the world,"" he said. Ivy Park x Adidas may be doing well, but athletic apparel industry expert Matt Powell of NDP Group says viral marketing campaigns from celebrity influencers have their limits. Powell pointed to Adidas's shoe deal with Kanye West to illustrate his point about product scarcity driving demand. The German company lured West away from Nike in 2013 before expanding production of his popular Yeezy Boost 350 sneakers in 2018. But once the Yeezys became more widely available, Powell said the shoes didn't sell as well. ""They put too many pairs in the market and nearly killed it off,"" Powell told CNN Business. ""It's kind of a conundrum. You have a shoe that is popular. People want it, but if it becomes widely available, they kind of lose interest."" Powell noted that Kanye's political antics and erratic behavior may have also played a role in the Yeezy's performance. Adidas may be limiting the volume of Kanye shoes it releases in 2020, but the company isn't showing any signs of easing up on Yeezy shoe titles this year. The sports apparel maker launched its Yeezy Quantum basketball high-top in the rapper's Chicago hometown in mid-February before dropping the Yeezy BOOST 350 V2 Earth on February 22. Rorsted said Yeezy fans can expect to see new products coming out more frequently. ""Not in high volume,"" he noted, ""but [we want] to continue to build on our brand equity as one of the most attractive and innovative brands.""",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/business/coronavirus-waffle-house-trnd/index.html,Waffle House closes 365 locations amid coronavirus pandemic,"In a Monday morning tweet, the Georgia-based dine-in business said it's closing 365 locations across the US. An additional 1,627 locations will remain open, the company said. A Waffle House spokesperson said Tuesday morning that the company will release a more detailed statement on the matter soon, declining to comment further. Waffle House is a restaurant chain known for staying open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in spite of most environmental conditions. Most of its 1,900+ restaurants are located in the nation's southeast. In the past, federal officials have been known to use them as a gauge to determine the severity of a hurricane, tornado or other hazards on a local area. Government officials in several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California and Ohio, have ordered bars and dine-in restaurants to temporarily close or limit their business to delivery and carryout orders to comply with social distancing recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The mandates have decimated foot traffic and overall business for many local restaurants across the country. Waffle House's website homepage now emphasizes its restaurants offer carryout orders.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/perspectives/voucher-coronavirus-stimulus-package/index.html,The missing piece from the stimulus package that could boost the economy,"To manage this dilemma, policymakers need to get creative. Instead of the usual formula of cutting interest rates — as the Fed just did — lowering taxes, or mailing people checks — as the White House and the Senate have agreed to do — we need targeted spending and regulatory interventions that stimulate the economy while promoting public health. One way to do that is by encouraging consumers to spend online.  When the Fed cuts interest rates, borrowing gets cheaper. Borrowers spend some of this cheap money on goods and services, such as restaurant meals and vacations. Similarly, President Trump's past proposal of lowering payroll taxes puts more money in people's pockets. If the stimulus works as planned, people spend the added money on services or goods.  In a typical recession, these effects are desirable. Unfortunately, what worked in previous recessions won't work for coronavirus. If schools and businesses are closed by order of public health authorities, then lower interest rates and tax cuts do not increase spending much. Instead, people are likely to save the money, undermining the stimulus effect. And if people do spend the money instead of saving it, monetary and fiscal stimulus may harm public health by encouraging people to go out and spend.  In response, economic policy needs to promote spending that improves, rather than detracts from, public health — a task that requires a mix of regulation and fiscal policy that I call ""law and macroeconomics.""  Because social distancing mandates have devastated the economy, policymakers need to find a way to rapidly increase spending and employment in the segments of the economy where increased spending does not endanger public health. Buying and selling goods and services virtually presents fewer health risks than doing so in person because it does not require in-person interaction. Many service providers, such as personal trainers and restaurant chefs, are suffering, but there is an opportunity for them to offer their services online because in-person demand has shriveled.  To boost virtual service provision, like online personal training or cooking instruction, Congress should send each US resident a $1,000 virtual services voucher that expires at the end of June.  Another voucher should be sent if the coronavirus continues to spread and social distancing continues into the next quarter. People could spend the voucher on services from any provider who signs a legal document asserting that they are providing online services. Because the voucher expires, people would spend the money quickly instead of saving it, stimulating the economy now and reducing unemployment in the services sector. At the same time, the voucher improves public health by shifting spending to less risky channels.   Responding to the interconnected threats of coronavirus and global recession requires creative policymaking. Ordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus will not work in this case. Instead, we need to promote virtual goods and services that keep the public healthy and stimulate the economy at the same time.  ",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/domestic-air-travel-shutdown/index.html,Should domestic air travel be grounded?,"Figures from the Transportation Security Administration show that only 331,000 people passed through TSA checkpoints Monday, a drop of more than 2 million passengers, or 86%, compared to the same Monday a year ago.  That's not surprising with 16 states, comprising 43% of US population, issuing orders that people should stay home whenever possible. Health professionals are saying that people should not gather in groups of 10 people or more or engage in any non-essential travel.  The Trump administration clearly does not want to order such a shutdown, especially as it negotiates a possible bailout of the airline industry. ""Although we've told people nonessential travel they shouldn't do, but [for] essential travel, we want to have airlines that operate, maybe on a more limited basis,"" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin when speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill a week ago.  Grounding all flights could actually be an economic benefit for airlines, which are undoubtedly losing money on every single flight. They are flying planes with only 20% to 30% of seats filled, far below the level needed to break even. That's true even as they slash their schedule by 50% or more in an effort to conserve cash. And the few seats they're selling are for a fraction of normal fares. A flight on United Airlines (UAL) from its Newark, NJ, hub to Atlanta on Tuesday is available for $48.40. A Delta (DAL) flight from Atlanta to Chicago is going for $44.40. A Southwest (LUV) flight from Baltimore-Washington to Los Angeles was available Tuesday morning for only $129. And an American (AAL) flight from Miami to Phoenix goes for $128.  And that's what the passengers are paying, not what the airlines are getting, due to the fees and taxes the passengers must pay. For example, Delta is getting only $27.91 on a $44.40 Atlanta to Chicago fare. ""What the industry should do is shut down,"" said Helane Becker, airline analyst with Cowen. ""Flying with 20% to 30% of seats filled with fares they're getting, they're just burning through cash. Pragmatically, they can't continue the way they are when people aren't traveling."" But the airline industry appears committed to continuing to fly as long as it can. ""We need to keep people and commerce moving. The best way to do that is on an airplane,"" Nick Calio, CEO of the trade group Airlines for America, told CNN. And the industry said that no matter the cost of operating, there is also  a cost that goes beyond economics in implementing a complete shutdown. ""It [a shutdown] might well have a lasting damage on the public's confidence in flying,"" he said. Despite the shutdown rumors, the industry doesn't believe it will happen.  ""It's never say never, but we haven't received any information that would suggest there have been any serious discussions about grounding domestic flights,"" Calio said. ""However, it's almost happening de facto because nobody's flying right now."" So far airlines have not cut their schedules nearly as deeply as the drop  in demand would suggest. Airlines removed about 9,000 flights from their original US schedules for March 23, according to tracking service Cirium, about 32% of the flights originally scheduled for that day. Deeper cuts have been announced for April and May, but it's still nowhere near the 86% drop in passengers now being reported. Canceling flights reduces the amount spent on fuel, spent on landing fees and on maintenance costs as they park unneeded jets. It could save on labor costs if airlines go ahead with staff furloughs and pay cuts that are being weighed. But union contracts might require the airlines to pay much of their staff for the next month that they are already scheduled to work. And wages are the largest cost for airlines. ""Your costs don't fall to nothing if you shut down the system,"" said airline consultant Mike Boyd. ""There's the debt service on the planes. You're still paying people under all kinds of union agreements."" Many airline employees would appreciate not flying, given the health crisis. Tens of thousands US employees in the industry have agreed to take unpaid leave. Others said they will work as long as their jobs are there, but that they'd rather see a shutdown. ""All these flight attendants are scared for themselves and their loved ones,"" one flight attendant told CNN. ""We're also scared to be transmitting this to other people which will result in someone dying. Maybe even one of our loved ones. At the same time we have to work because we see our industry crashing and we have bills to pay."" There would be health risks even if the system was shut down, though. Many of the 300,000 passengers who still fly every day could opt to drive to their destinations, which in itself might result in an increase car accidents, injuries and even traffic deaths, said Boyd. -- CNN's Greg Wallace and Paul Murphy contributed to this report",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/supply-chain-clothing-retail-coronavirus/index.html,Huge discounts on spring wardrobes are coming,"The t-shirts, jackets, sneakers and jeans they were gearing up to push out for the spring shopping season now sit sitting in darkened stores and warehouses during the coronavirus crisis. Demand for discretionary items has come to a screeching halt as customers focus on stocking up on the basics they need to survive. ""This is going to be an unprecedented level of inventory that's available,"" said Jamie Merriman, retail analyst at Bernstein. ""We haven't seen demand on a global basis take this sharp a hit in my lifetime."" Retailers made decisions months ago about what to buy from their suppliers, when the economy was strong and consumer spending was projected to be robust. They could not have imagined that they would be grossly overestimating demand.   ""This is an event that there is no systemic capacity to predict or respond to,"" said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at the Columbia Business School. ""Everybody is trapped."" There is an ""enormous volume of goods already sitting on retailers' shelves or sitting in the pipeline. It's going to have to be flushed out,"" Cohen said. As the United States economy crashes into a recession, retailers and brands will have to use a variety of tactics to unload excess inventory. They will try to sell some of it through their online channels. And they'll push it through their outlet and factory stores where they can. But retailers can't easily replace store sales. In 2019, only one-quarter of apparel and footwear sales came from online, according to Euromonitor.  And during a pandemic and an economic downturn, consumers are not splurging on new shoes or clothes.  ""People aren't interested in buying anything but the things they need to stay alive,"" said Cohen. ""There's almost no one ... forced to walk around naked."" Retailers will need to promote heavily to move their clothing off store shelves as quickly as possible to prepare for summer and fall, experts say. This will dent their profits -- assuming they have any. ""The only option will become pretty steep discounts,"" said Merriman from Bernstein. ""There's really nothing the retailers can do about it."" ""While you'll start to see some discounting now, you'll see it to a greater extent once stores re-open,"" she said. Some big retailers are already signalling that this will be their strategy. ""This reduced demand may lead to lower sales, higher markdowns and an overly promotional environment,"" Nordstrom  (JWN)warned in a filing Friday.  Ironically, some stores may benefit from the excess supply of clothing. Discount chains such as TJX (TJX), the parent of TJMaxx and Marshalls, and Ross (ROST) are taking a hit now because stores are closed and they don't sell online. But traditionally, when there is a glut of merchandise available in the market, these chains have more options to step in and scoop it up at lower prices to sell at theirstores. ""Eventually, this will be very good for off-price,"" said Merriman.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/media/fox-news-trump-town-hall/index.html,Fox News anchors fail to challenge Trump as he misleads during coronavirus town hall,"While Fox News is known as the home to such pro-Trump hosts as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, Tuesday's town hall was held by Bill Hemmer and Harris Faulkner, two anchors the network bills as members of a supposedly fearless and hard-hitting news division. But neither Hemmer, who is the chief breaking news anchor at Fox News and was broadcasting from the White House, nor Faulkner, who was broadcasting remotely from a studio, effectively pushed back on Trump during the two-hour event -— despite obvious misinformation peddled by the President.  Trump, for instance, repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the seasonal flu. ""We've never closed down the country for the flu,"" the President said.  Hemmer, however, repeatedly failed to note that Covid-19 has a significantly higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu.  The World Health Organization has estimated the mortality rate to be 3.4%. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, has estimated that it is about 2%. Fauci even previously told Fox News, ""The mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1% so even if [Covid-19] goes down to 1% it's still 10 times more fatal."" At another point during the interview, Trump said he would ""love"" for the country to ""open by Easter"" on April 12.  Instead of challenging Trump, and noting that his deadline is at odds with what many medical professionals and infectious disease experts have said, Faulkner replied, ""Oh wow. OK.""  Hemmer added, ""That would be a great American resurrection.""  After being criticized online for his failure to follow up, Hemmer came back from a commercial break and asked Trump the question again: ""You'd like to be back to normal by Easter Sunday. That's 19 days from now. Is that true? Is that possible?"" Trump replied to Hemmer, saying he believed it to be possible and once again compared it to the much less serious seasonal flu. Hemmer asked Trump how he could determine it might be safe, and Trump reiterated his belief that the country ""has to get back to work."" In one jarring moment, Trump assailed Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who criticized the federal government hours earlier for not sending enough ventilators to the state.  ""He should have ordered the ventilators, and he had a choice. He had a chance,"" Trump said. ""Because right here, I just got this out,"" he added, reading from a piece of paper. ""That he refused to order 15,000 ventilators. I will show this to Bill."" The article Trump read to Hemmer -— and the Fox News audience at large — appeared to be from the Gateway Pundit, a fringe outlet with a long history of peddling right-wing conspiracy theories. ""NY Gov. Cuomo Rejected Buying Recommended 16,000 Ventilators in 2015 for Pandemic, Established Death Panels and Lottery Instead,"" was the headline Trump read aloud, the same as one posted on the Gateway Pundit's website Sunday. ""He shouldn't be talking about us,"" Trump then said. ""He's supposed to be buying his own ventilators."" Hemmer did not challenge Trump -- on either the source of the information or Trump's suggestion that the federal government doesn't bear any responsibility for providing ventilators given that Cuomo could have made the purchase nearly five years before the coronavirus outbreak. A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Fox News has only recently started to take the coronavirus more seriously. For weeks, top hosts and personalities on the network downplayed the coronavirus. Personalities — such as Hannity  Ingraham — told their audiences that news coverage of the virus was aimed at hurting Trump politically.  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease. Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/olive-garden-chilis-coronavirus/index.html,"Olive Garden, Chili's and other restaurant chains are at risk","Many are limiting seating. Some are shutting their doors altogether. Darden Restaurants -- which owns Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and other casual dining chains -- shared bleak news when it reported financial results Thursday. In the first half of last week, sales at some restaurants open at least 16 months fell as much as 60% compared to the same period in 2019. The company pulled its full-year guidance and told shareholders it was suspending its quarterly dividend. Darden is hardly alone. Independent operators have warned the closures could put them out of business for good, and massive companies are also scrambling to adjust.  Starbucks (SBUX) has temporarily closed its cafes in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, McDonald's (MCD) is closing stores, including for takeout.  Major casual dining chains, like Olive Garden, IHOP and Chili's, are better equipped to weather the storm than mom-and-pop chains or independent fine-dining restaurants.  Despite their size, however, the chains are still in a precarious position.  Most casual dining chains don't have drive-thrus. They market themselves as spots for families or friends to visit together, to socialize in person and t be waited on by staff.  That business model is now a liability. These days, those chains have to quickly figure out ways to ramp up off-premise orders while keeping their companies afloat.  ""Most of the bigger players will find a way to survive,"" said R.J. Hottovy, a consumer strategist for Morningstar. But ""it's not going to be easy.""  A clear disadvantage Casual dining is ""all about the experience,"" said Hottovy. So restrictions on dining rooms are ""a major shock to the system."" Nick Setyan, a restaurant analyst for Wedbush Securities, said that ""clearly, the casual diners are disadvantaged,"" when compared to fast casual and fast food chains, which have been investing in takeout, delivery and their drive-thru services.  As they try to enhance delivery options, casual dining chains will likely ramp up partnerships with third-party delivery services like Grubhub or Postmates, Setyan said. Delivery and takeout orders will increase, he added, but ""it's not going to come anywhere close"" to the business they usually get from dine-in customers. On Thursday, Darden shared that about 60% of its restaurants were to-go only. Over the weekend, it switched 100% of restaurants over to that model. Brinker International, which owns Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy, is at 75% to 80% takeout and delivery, said CEO Wyman Roberts last week, adding that the company has ""changed all of our messaging"" to let customers know about the shift. At both Darden and Brinker, restaurant managers are helping fill takeout orders.  Even if delivery orders do increase, casual dining chains may not see good returns. ""The economics work for large orders,"" like catering and group deliveries, Hottovy said. They might not for individual ones.  And more trouble could be ahead. Even once the social distancing efforts ease, casual dining chains may find themselves with fewer customers.  We're already in a global recession, according to S&P Global. In the United States, unemployment rates are soaring. An economic downturn could prompt casual dining customers to forgo those meals and turn instead to cheaper options like fast food.  ""In a recessionary environment, you're not going to see casual diners get their sales back to pre-Covid 19 levels as quickly as many of us would have hoped,"" Setyan said. Staying afloat Still, major chains with good cash flow should be able to stay in business.  Darden now has about $1 billion in cash because of its decision to skip the quarterly dividend and eliminate nonessential spending, among other cost-cutting efforts. With that much money on hand, ""we'll be able to weather this disruption to our business,"" said CFO Ricardo Cardenas during a recent call with analysts.  Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, announced recently that it has drawn down $223 million in a ""precautionary"" step ""to increase the company's financial flexibility."" The company also withdrew its full-year guidance.  A handful of casual dining firms are also asking the government for help, arguing that they're in a unique position compared to other restaurants and chains.  ""We're just wanting to make sure, as state and federal officers think about relief and support, that they understand that it's not all the small business model or the franchise model,"" Roberts said. ""There are significant companies out there that own restaurants, that support large employee bases that are critical to the economy that are going to need to be considered, as well.""  Brinker International, along with the other chains lobbying for support, employ over 500,000 altogether, he said. ",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/business/us-airline-in-flight-changes/index.html,Airlines are doing away with middle seats and beverage service,"Major US airlines are implementing substantial changes to the few free things passengers still receive on airplanes, including drinks and snacks, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Delta Air Lines, Southwest and American Airlines have all announced this week that they're temporarily suspending beverage service and cutting meal service as a way to cut costs and reduce the number of items flight attendants touch.  The changes, which seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago, are the latest change for the beleaguered industry that has dealt with plummeting revenue, strikingly empty flights and the need for government assistance just to survive the year. Some in the industry are calling for domestic flight operations to be temporarily shut down. Here's what fliers will notice: American Airlines Beginning March 27 and for the following month, flights on American (AAL) that are shorter than 4.5 hours will no longer serve meals in first class. Snacks and food available for purchase in the main cabin have been canceled. And beverages will be available only upon request. It also will no longer sell alcohol in economy, but will continue to serve it in first class.  American is making fewer changes on its long-haul flights, of which there are fewer, anyway, because of travel restrictions from other countries. Separately, American has shuttered a number of its pre-flight lounges and is no longer accepting checked pets. To encourage social distancing policies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American is reassigning seats to customers so they don't have to sit next to someone else. That means most people will be able to avoid the dreaded middle seat. The changes were made easier because many airlines are flying with only 20% to 30% of seats filled. Delta Air Lines Beginning immediately on domestic and some shorter international flights, Delta (DAL) is reducing the number of snack offerings to two, giving its first class passengers boxed meals and completely eliminating alcoholic drinks for everyone. The only beverage available to order is bottled water. The changes are in addition to eliminating glassware and hot towels in first class.  The airline said it's currently ""evaluating adjustments"" for its long-haul international flights. A number of its pre-flight lounges, known as the Sky Club, have also been closed because of dwindling passenger traffic.  Southwest Airlines Southwest (LUV) doesn't have first class cabins or lounges, but it's also making changes. It's suspending beverage and snack service beginning Wednesday to ""limit close public interactions"" between customers and its crew. Canned water will be made available by request.  United Airlines United (UAL) told CNN Business that it doesn't have immediate plans to make changes similar to its rivals. It has tweaked how it's offering snacks by serving them on a tray instead of letting passengers pick their own, no longer refilling beverages and letting their flight attendants wear gloves during flights.

The new payment limit will be operational in some shops across the United Kingdom from April 1, the British Retail Consortium said in a statement Tuesday, adding that raising the contactless spending limit would ""reduce the need for physical contact."" Other countries have brought in measures to reduce the handling of cash following the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 380,000 people globally and killed more than 16,500, according to Johns Hopkins University. There is still a lot not known about the virus, but it appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization. Earlier this month, South Korea's central bank said it would quarantine incoming cash from local banks for two weeks to ensure the notes are not carrying the virus, according to Reuters. China also launched a massive initiative around deep cleaning potentially infected cash with ultraviolet light and high temperatures, and in some cases, destroying it.  There are several other mobile and contactless payment options ranging from Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay, where consumers use smartphones or smartwatches to pay in stores, to credit cards with a NFC chip, allowing shoppers to hold them near a reader to pay. ""The last contactless limit increase to £30 took two years to implement but, given the extraordinary circumstances we face today, this new £45 limit will be rolled-out from next week,"" Andrew Cregan, head of payments policy for the British Retail Consortium, said in a statement. ""Some shops will take longer to make the necessary changes, given the strain they're under. In the meantime, most customers can continue to make contactless payments for higher amounts using their smart phone,"" he added.  The British Retail Consortium said in a statement that it may take some time before the measure is applied everywhere in the country. ",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/business/social-distancing-brand-logos-coronavirus/index.html,McDonald's and other brands are making 'social distancing' logos,"McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Audi and Volkswagen are just a few of the corporate conglomerates that are interpreting ""social distancing"" with logo redesigns.  The term has become popular recently because of the spread of the novel coronavirus. Social distancing means standing 6 feet apart from others in an effort to lower the risk of contracting the illness.  The messages and logos created to promote social distancing have pros and cons, according to two experts in the design field. ""Our current global situation is no joke. It's a serious matter,"" Douglas Sellers, executive creative director for firm Siegel+Gale told CNN Business.  ""And brands designing social distancing logos have the potential to diminish the severity of what we are going through. The creativity, passion, and thought that goes into wanting to help, educate, and be part of the physical distancing movement is a worthy note,"" Sellers said.  Brian Braiker, the editor-in-chief of Ad Age, says its time for brands to provide a ""real, meaningful service,"" referencing companies like the Gap (GPS) making masks for healthcare workers or LVMH, the parent company of Christian Dior and Givenchy, manufacturing hand sanitizer. ""Understanding the situation, shutting up and doing something helpful is really the only way to go here. When you see brands like McDonald's or Coca-Cola spacing out their logos in 'solidarity,' it strikes a sour note,"" he told CNN Business.  McDonald's Brazil Last week, McDonald's (MCD) Brazil pulled apart its iconic golden arches in a picture posted to its Facebook page. The ad agency explained that despite the temporary separation between its customers and the company caused by closures of some of its restaurants, they ""can always be together."" McDonald's is offering food through delivery and drive-thru.  The McDonald's ad sparked backlash, including from Senator Bernie Sanders, who tweeted Wednesday about the company's sick leave policy for its employees. The company didn't immediately return CNN Business' request for comment about the ad. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO) is currently running an ad in New York's deserted Times Square that shows each letter of its logo separated with the slogan ""Staying apart is the best way to stay connected."" The brand typically celebrates togetherness and love in its ads. Audi and Volkswagen Two automotive companies that share ownership, Audi and Volkswagen, tweaked their logos for their social media accounts.  Audi separated its four rings in a short video telling people to stay at home and keep their distance.  Volkswagen also promoted a similar video with inspirational messages and separated the V and W. Nike Nike (NKE) didn't tweak its logo, but it launched a large social media campaign with its global roster of star athletes including NBA player LeBron James and golfer Tiger Woods. Sports ground to a halt in the past few weeks because of social distancing rules and the ban on large gatherings, like in stadiums. The campaign encourages people to play inside. Nike had to close several of its global stores because of the virus. ",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/investing/ceo-giving-up-pay-coronavirus/index.html,Why CEOs are giving up their salaries during the coronavirus crisis,"Executive pay cuts alone aren't likely to have a significant impact on companies' bottom lines or provide a boost to lower-paid employees further down the org chart. But they send an important message. ""A lot of it is symbolic,"" Itay Goldstein, professor of finance University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said. ""When we come into a crisis like the one we have right now — where it's a difficult time for the economy, for workers, people are losing their jobs, people don't know what to expect — I think for CEOs to come out and say, 'We are going to give up our pay,' it's a signal that they are sharing the pain.""  Airlines and travel companies, one of the industries hit hardest by the outbreak early on, were among the first to take such a step, including Delta (DAL), Alaska (ALK), United Airlines (UAL) and others, which all announced CEO pay cuts, and other executive compensation reductions.  Marriott (MAR), the world's largest hotel chain, said last week that CEO Arne Sorenson will not take home any salary for the rest of the year, and the rest of the executive team will take a 50% pay cut. The announcement came at the same time that the company said it would begin furloughing what could be tens of thousands of hotel workers, from housekeepers to general managers. Online travel company Booking Holdings (BKNG) said Monday that CEO Glen Fogel, as well as the CEOs of the company's three brand divisions, would forgo his salary. Booking's board directors also volunteered to give up their cash retainers.  On Wednesday, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) also announced its CEO Ed Stack and President Lauren Hobart will forgo their salaries, except for an amount covering company-provided benefits. The company's other named executive officers will take a 50% reduction in base salary.  Other companies, including Ford (F), GE (GESLX) and Lyft (LYFT) have taken similar steps.   ""Every single dollar, euro, bhat, etc., counts in this effort to ensure we can continue to be the leader in online travel on the other side of this crisis, said Booking's Fogel said in a letter to employees Monday.  ""Every employee has a responsibility to contribute to our cost-saving efforts and be as efficient as possible.""  A symbolic gesture But at companies of that size, while CEOs and other top executives generally bring home millions of dollars, their salaries are insignificant relative to the company's overall revenue — certainly not enough to keep a distressed operation's finances afloat, Goldstein said. Many of the companies are taking other steps, too, such as changing their operating schedules and cutting unnecessary capital expenditures.  However, the pressure on top executives to take some sort of action may be particularly high at the moment.  The amount of money that top executives at big corporations make relative to other workers has been a growing conservation since the 2008 recession, when federal officials mandated that companies publicly disclose that ratio. And the gap has continued to expand in recent years. Even Abigail Disney, granddaughter of company co-founder Roy Disney, called out the Disney CEO for his massive pay package. Delta CEO Ed Bastian's total pay in 2018, for example, makes 184 times the median of the total compensation of all employees, according to the company's most recent proxy statement.  Coronavirus also hit at the same time most companies are calculating yearly bonuses for executives and other staff from the prior year, making it a particularly awkward time to lay off employees, said Eric Talley, professor of law and faculty director of the Millstein Center at Columbia University.  Although a CEO foregoing their salary typically won't mean game- changing savings for their company, it's still a move workers likely want to see. ""It's about having an appropriate tone at the top,"" Talley said. ""There might be companies that did really well in 2019 and suddenly your company has hit a brick wall. So at the same time you're laying off a bunch of rank and file employees, you're awarding yourself (millions in bonus pay). It just doesn't look very good.""  How it's done matters But the effect of the gesture may also depend on the details of executives' pay reductions. Some companies have said their executives will forgo their base salaries, while others have indicated that execs will give up virtually all of their pay. Base salaries typically make up a small part of named executive officers' total compensation, which is often largely comprised of performance based compensation such as stocks, options and bonuses.  United Airlines, for instance, said its CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby are ""foregoing 100% of their respective base salaries through at least June 30,"" according to a March 10 filing with the SEC. But in 2018, per United's most recent proxy statement, Munoz's base salary made up just 9% of his total compensation — or $1.25 million of the nearly $10.5 million total he earned that year. Kirby's base salary comprised 16% of his total compensation.  Executives' performance-based compensation will also suffer at a time when companies are bleeding money and stocks are down because of the disruption coronavirus has caused to their business and to financial markets. Even if giving up their pay won't be enough cost savings to let companies avoid laying off workers amid the crisis, sending a strong message of solidarity to employees may prove important for executives when companies start to recover, Talley said.  ""It's a message I think many employees want to hear,"" Talley said. ""Some of these employees are reliable, skilled, good employees, so these companies are anticipating, thinking, 'We want to be in a position to have these employees to come back, and we want to hire them back, when the economy starts turning around.'""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/local-restaurants-coronavirus-closures-layoffs/index.html,Coronavirus closures 'could ruin us.' Local restaurants fear for survival,"Lee Goodfriend watched business slow to a crawl at her neighborhood eatery that's been a local institution since 1983. Facing a mandated eight-week closure, she laid off the entire 125-person staff so workers could immediately apply for unemployment.  ""It was terrible, and I am still sick about it,"" she said.  Linda McInerney, 50, was waiting tables full-time last week at P.J. Clarke's storied Manhattan locale off 55th and Third. Earlier this week, she spent hours helping her older colleagues file for social security benefits and unemployment. ""I wish I could do more,"" she said.  Shockwaves are rippling through the nation's restaurant industry amid mandated curfews or closings aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. Operators are bracing for the worst as the disruptions -- some fear will be indefinite -- threaten to devastate a vulnerable subset of America: small businesses that squeak by on paper-thin margins and workers who live paycheck to paycheck. Requests for social distancing and remote working have quickly turned into calls for self-isolation and -- in certain regions -- orders to stay at home. An increasing number of states have placed limits on gathering places, some mandating that restaurants and bars close or operate limited service. ""This is wholly unprecedented in that the entire industry is essentially being shut down in a lot of ways,"" said David Henkes, senior principal with foodservice consulting firm Technomic. Heading into 2020, Technomic predicted that foodservice industry sales would increase 3.8% from the $938.4 billion of revenue recorded last year.  All bets are off now. The nation's restaurant industry consists of more than 1 million restaurants -- about 70% of them small and independent -- employing 15.6 million people. Restaurants could very well lose $225 billion in sales and incur job losses in the range of 5 million to 7 million, the National Restaurant Association wrote this week in a letter to President Donald Trump and senior federal lawmakers seeking $325 billion in aid.  Massive layoffs have already started to take place.  ""Without aggressive and immediate action from the federal government, many restaurants that are a staple of local communities will simply never resume service,"" Sean Kennedy, the association's executive vice president of public affairs wrote in the letter. The family business When his father, Carlo, passed suddenly in 2018, Vincent Schiattarella took over Carlo's Italian Bistro in Cockeysville, Maryland.   ""Losing my father was not only devastating to me and my family, it was also devastating to the business for a time,"" he said. ""I have worked hard to run the bistro the way my father would have wanted me to."" That heart-wrenching transition and, before then, the Great Recession toughened up Schiattarella for navigating the ups and downs of the restaurant business. He's learned the hard way how small business loans can go south and how difficult it is to recover after exhausting personal savings.  But Schiattarella's not certain his restaurant will survive the latest fallout from events beyond his control. The state of Maryland mandated that businesses cease dine-in service for at least two weeks. Sales are down to 5% to 10% of what they would normally be, and he's down to just himself and a chef trying to serve up to-go orders. ""I'm praying for the best right now,"" he said, noting he took out a $20,000 loan on his credit card. ""We need a bail out. If we don't get one, we're not going to survive."" The neighborhood gathering place Lee Goodfriend and David Racine have been fixtures in the Denver, Colorado, restaurant scene for decades. Their remaining restaurant, Racines, in its 37th year, still attracted a healthy lunch clientele and a packed weekend brunch crowd.  In a matter of days, Goodfriend would find herself alone in the spacious restaurant, closing out paychecks and shutting down machinery in preparation for a two-month pause in business. When Denver's mayor on Monday ordered that bars and restaurants close in-house service, Goodfriend and Racine made the gut-wrenching decision to lay off themselves and their employees with the hope that unemployment claims could be filed and they could be rehired when the business reopens. They took $125,000 out of savings to pay out employees' vacation days and sent workers home with the extra food from the restaurant. Goodfriend is optimistic that Racines could weather the two-month closure and hopefully hire back the employees because she and Racine have ""saved a lot of money for a rainy day."" ""It's about as rainy as you get,"" she said.  A New York institution Linda McInerney cut her teeth working in an auditing firm and, before her son was born, she would supplement her income on the weekends by working in restaurants.  ""As it turns out, I have a real passion for the hospitality industry,"" she said. ""It was easy to go back to the industry I love because as servers we can make money at night while the kids are asleep and still be present in their everyday life."" P.J. Clarke's, a nearly 140-year-old New York haunt, was a home away from home.  ""Most of the people I work with are just hardworking people who just want to live their lives,"" said McInerney, of Brooklyn. She forged close bonds with her co-workers, whether they were 20-something or 86 years old. Her employers were supportive of her medical needs related to a cancer diagnosis.  When McInerney and crew were laid off due to the temporary closure, she quickly sought to help colleagues sign up for unemployment benefits or social security for the interim. Ideally, McInerney said, the layoff will be temporary and she and other employees will be rehired.   McInerney calls herself fortunate, her husband works for the fire department, she said she's worried about her colleagues.  ""There's a lot of really amazing people in our industry -- they're dancers and actors and people in their 50s and 60s,"" she said. ""Most people think that [restaurant workers] are 21 and 22 with headshots, but that's not the truth. There are a lot of lifelong hospitality workers relying on this. And it's not just the young people that are affected. It really spans the whole gamut of ages.""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/business/coronavirus-help-for-self-employed/index.html,Help is coming for gig economy workers and small businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis,"In the United States, the federal government is poised to extend unemployment insurance payments to gig economy workers for up to 39 weeks, and top them up by an extra $600 a week, as part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package. The UK government on Thursday unveiled what finance minister Rishi Sunak described as ""one of the most generous"" support programs anywhere in the world for Britain's 5 million self-employed workers.  The plan mirrors wage subsidies promised last week to people in regular employment, providing the self-employed with a cash grant of 80% of their average monthly profit, up to £2,500 ($3,000) a month, over the next quarter.  Millions of people who don't have full-time employment or who own businesses that rely on people getting together — such as taxi drivers, food delivery workers, builders, hairdressers and cafe owners — have been left unable to earn an income as governments shut down non-essential services and introduce strict social distancing measures. In many cases they face an impossible choice: break lockdown rules, or stay home and earn nothing. Before Thursday's announcement, self-employed workers in the United Kingdom were only getting tax relief and £94 ($114) a week through the benefits system. Josie Ferguson, a 24-year old assistant buyer in London's film and television industry, said she is losing £700 ($850) a week because a production she was working on has been postponed.  ""It's a complete shutdown. People won't get paid and we get no help because we are contracted workers,"" she told CNN Business. Ferguson considers herself lucky because she can live with her parents and has savings, but she said her friends in London will struggle to pay rent. Uber (UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi welcomed the support proposed by the US government in the huge package that won Senate approval on Wednesday.  ""The 1.3 million Americans who drive and deliver with Uber are facing extraordinary economic challenges,"" he said in a statement. ""Those who've lost the opportunity to earn need and deserve this support."" A record 3.28 million Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week, the most in more than 50 years, according to the Department of Labor. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that about 15.9 million Americans, or 10% of the country's workforce, are self-employed. What's happening in Europe?  Governments across Europe have already announced measures to help their self-employed workers, although they vary widely in scope and generosity. In Germany, the region's largest economy, companies with up to five employees qualify for a one-off grant of €9,000 ($9,900), while those with 10 employees will receive €15,000 ($16,500). The government has made an additional €3 billion ($3.3 billion) available to enhance social security benefits for the self-employed.  In France, small businesses and freelancers who make less than €60,000 ($66,000) a year can apply for €1,500 ($1,650) in aid if they are forced to close or if their revenue falls by more than 70% this month compared with March 2019.  Other support measures include reduced tax and social security payments, as well as a payment holiday on rent and utilities. Italy's 5 million self-employed workers, about 23% of the workforce, are receiving less support. The government's pledge to subsidize 80% of employee salaries for nine weeks does not apply to them. Instead, they will receive a one-off payment of €600 ($660) and tax relief. — Eoin McSweeney, Pierre Buet, Hada Messia, Stephanie Halasz and Anneken Tappe contributed to this report.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/tech/uber-lyft-financial-aid-coronavirus/index.html,Uber and Lyft still aren't helping their most vulnerable drivers,"While Knesek, 36, doesn't have coronavirus, she is immunosuppressed. She received a kidney transplant just over a year ago and is on medication that limits her body's ability to fight off infections and diseases. ""My doctor advises to only go out when I need lab tests,"" she said, adding that she has a note from her doctor indicating she is in the category of people who should be isolated at home. On March 7, Uber was the first of the on-demand gig companies to say it would compensate workers who are diagnosed with coronavirus or are placed in mandatory quarantine for up to 14 days. It shared more details on March 15 about the policy, with criteria that said drivers who were ""personally asked to self-isolate by a public health authority or licensed medical provider"" could apply for the financial assistance by providing a doctor's note. On March 18, Uber added more specific language on its page about coronavirus financial support that rules out Knesek's eligibility. The criteria now states that drivers and delivery people who ""are personally asked by a public health authority or licensed medical provider to self-isolate due to your risk of spreading COVID-19"" can qualify. It does not say anything about those who are staying home with underlying conditions because they are more vulnerable to contracting the virus. As public health authorities have advised, these people are at risk for serious complications if they contract the virus.  As cases of coronavirus rack up across the US, the people who give rides, deliver groceries or restaurant orders for gig economy companies are on the frontlines of the outbreak. Gig workers have long had a contentious relationship with the companies they work for, and that tension is increasingly palpable in the midst of this unprecedented public health crisis. Many can't afford to stay home and not work but are getting little support from the companies they work for. Because the companies largely treat their workers as independent contractors -- a status that is currently being challenged in the state of California -- they don't receive benefits such as health insurance, paid time off or sick leave. In the wake of the outbreak, many of the gig economy companies agreed to offer a form of paid sick leave for the first time for drivers who are diagnosed with coronavirus or placed under mandatory quarantine. The financial assistance from Uber, for example, is based on a driver's average daily earnings over the past six months, so the payout can range from $400 to $1,700.  But several drivers told CNN Business they believed they would qualify for much-needed financial assistance from Uber if they had underlying health conditions based on the initial language the company detailed. Some, like Knesak, attempted to apply for assistance before the company further updated its language to specify people would only qualify if they were at risk of spreading coronavirus. Others do not have access to health insurance or a primary care physician to provide a doctor's note even if the company would consider it. ""The growing fear and disruption caused by the coronavirus is being felt by everyone around the world. We know this is especially true for people who drive and deliver with Uber,"" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. ""We have a dedicated team working around the clock to support drivers and delivery people. We are providing up to 14 days financial assistance to drivers diagnosed with COVID-19, or individually asked to be quarantined by a public health authority due to a risk of spreading COVID-19 as announced on 3/15."" In a statement to CNN Business, Lyft said: ""This is an unprecedented situation and we are doing everything we can to meet the challenge. We have already diverted team members away from other areas to handle these inquiries full-time, and are actively adding more resources, to help address these inquiries as quickly as possible."" Lyft's language states that it will only support ""affected drivers who are identified to us by public health officials or who contact our support team to self-report and provide documentation that they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or put under individual quarantine by a public health agency."" DoorDash and Instacart have similarly said they will only compensate workers who have tested positive for coronavirus or are placed under mandatory quarantine. Meanwhile, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi appealed to President Donald Trump in a letter sent earlier this week to provide economic support for Uber drivers and other independent contract workers. Khosrowshahi said ""my greatest responsibility in the face of unprecedented economic challenge is to the millions of people who drive and deliver on Uber's platform."" He was careful to characterize it not as a ""bailout for Uber"" but ""rather for support for independent contractors."" Gig workers would be eligible to receive federal aid under the $2 trillion emergency package approved by the US Senate Thursday. It extends unemployment insurance to gig workers, including four months of $600 per week. The bill is pending a vote in the House. Also this week, a group of San Francisco Supervisors introduced a resolution calling on government officials to enforce the new California AB-5 law so workers could access protections as employees such as unemployment insurance and paid sick leave.  In the meantime, though, some drivers need to work but also know doing so could compromise their health. Steve Gregg, an Uber driver in the Bay Area who organizes for Gig Workers Rising, said he similarly attempted to apply for financial aid last week using a doctor's note, before Uber added more specificity to its policy. Gregg, 51, said he has several underlying conditions that make him stay home amid the pandemic. He's borderline diabetic, has compromised lungs, and high blood pressure.  He received a rejection notice from Uber that said he was not ""eligible for financial assistance because your documentation does not indicate that you have been exposed to COVID19, have been tested for COVID19, or have been diagnosed with COVID19.""  ""I don't know what I'm going to do,"" said Gregg, who noted he does not have health insurance. He had a weekly Avis car rental payment of $250 per week, something he gave up this week.  Erica Mighetto, an Uber and Lyft driver who is currently in the Berkeley area, said she similarly has a car loan to pay for, but has a heart condition and is fearful about continuing to work. ""My car payment is a month behind, I need to make another payment on the 28th.""  Mighetto, 38, who organizes with another driver advocacy group called Rideshare Drivers United, said she did not attempt to apply for financial aid through the companies because she does not have a primary care physician, or health insurance, and would not be able to provide a doctor's note. Even if she could, as Gregg and Knesek have learned, an underlying condition wouldn't be enough to qualify her. ""As gig economy workers we are put in a really tough spot -- you'd think it would be a really easy decision,"" she told CNN Business. ""If I don't work and we get past all of this, I'm not just starting from square one, I'm starting without a car.""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/intl_business/uk-mortgage-extensions/index.html,UK lenders offer mortgage extensions as banks and customers grapple with coronavirus disruptions,"In the United Kingdom, mortgage providers have announced they will give home buyers who have already signed contracts the option to extend their mortgage offers for up to three months. The measure will allow customers to push their moves back to a later date, according to a Thursday statement from UK Finance, the trade organization for the country's banking and finance sector.  The policy will help people whose moving plans have been disrupted by a loss of work as well as self-isolation policies and social distancing recommendations.  It could also alleviate pressure on banks. The capacity of lenders is being stretched at a time when they are facing internal operational headaches, splitting workforces between headquarters in central London, backup sites miles outside the city and home offices.  ""It is clearly not appropriate for people shielding or self-isolating to move home,"" Chief Executive of UK Finance Stephen Jones said in a statement. ""Therefore where chains contain people in these groups, lenders, conveyancers and other professionals are working together to enable these customers' moves to be delayed."" The extension also takes into account that some new mortgage customers could see a dramatic change in income over the next several months as authorities struggle to get a handle on the pandemic. Anticipating the massive hit to the UK economy and workforce, the government earlier this week unveiled an unprecedented intervention in the British economy, saying it will cover 80% of worker salaries for at least the next three months up to a maximum of £2,500 ($2,900) a month, which is more than the average income. ""People who would have been preparing and expecting to move house in the coming weeks now face a wait until Covid-19 restrictions can be lifted... Our heads are clear that it would be unfair for these people to have to start their mortgage application all over again once life returns to a more normal state,"" Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association, said in a statement. Lloyds Banking Group said Thursday it is adjusting some product offerings to manage the situation. It has temporarily withdrawn new mortgage and remortgage products with loan to value ratios of over 60% available via its intermediary brands. Customers can still apply for a mortgage directly online with Halifax and Lloyds Bank. ",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/business/mortgage-payment-coronavirus-stimulus-federal-reserve/index.html,The $2 trillion stimulus will slam the mortgage industry -- unless the Fed comes to the rescue ,"The $2 trillion stimulus package that passed the US Senate Wednesday will allow homeowners hurt by the health crisis to postpone mortgage payments for up to 12 months. That mirrors moves announced last week by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The goal is to make sure the millions of job losses caused by the social distancing restrictions imposed by governments don't spark a wave of foreclosures. That domino effect would crash the real estate market, amplifying the considerable economic pain inflicted by the health crisis.   But that wave of missed mortgage payments threatens to spark a crippling cash crunch in the real estate finance industry unless the Federal Reserve steps in with even more emergency lending. Analysts expect the Fed to step in soon after the stimulus package becomes law. The House of Representatives is expected to pass the stimulus bill Friday.  The problem is that mortgage servicers, even after granting homeowners forbearance, are still on the hook with investors to continue paying principal and interest on the mortgages. They also must make payments to mortgage insurers, property insurers and local tax authorities.   And that could be a hefty sum given the economic carnage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Initial claims for unemployment benefits skyrocketed to record highs. Mortgage servicers don't have enough cash to cover the coming wave of missed mortgage payments. And a series of defaults by servicers would cripple a key part of the economy. ""It would be complete contagion. It would turn into a housing crisis,"" Jay Bray, CEO of mortgage servicing firm Mr. Cooper, told CNN Business.   Mr. Cooper (COOP), one of the nation's largest nonbank mortgage servicers, expects that one in four Americans could ultimately request mortgage payment deferrals.   $75 billion cash crunch The bill passed by the Senate would allow borrowers with federally backed mortgages who have a financial hardship directly or indirectly from the coronavirus pandemic to request forbearance. Borrowers can postpone mortgage payments for 180 days without incurring fees or penalties. And they can request to extend that forbearance for another 180 days.   This is not loan forgiveness. The missed mortgage payments would still be owed eventually, likely by extending the duration of the loan.   The mortgage industry, like many others, is turning to the Fed to invoke emergency powers and serve its role as the lender of last resort. In this case, the US central bank would provide a line of credit mortgage servicers could draw on to make the payments to mortgage investors on behalf of borrowers.  ""It can't come fast enough. We need a solution now. People are going to stop making their payments as early as April,"" Bray said. ""American homeowners are going to be hit like never before. This is unprecedented.""  The Mortgage Bankers Association, the industry's lobby group, said it has held talks with the Fed and the Treasury Department for the past few weeks on this request for help.   ""They have been very understanding of this issue and the need for liquidity,"" Robert Broeksmit, CEO of the MBA, told CNN Business.   The MBA estimates that if one-quarter of borrowers request forbearance for six months or longer, advancing requirements on mortgage servicers could exceed $75 billion.   ""The cash demand from what could be a large spike in missed payments would overwhelm the sector,"" Broeksmit said.   Broeksmit wrote a letter Sunday to the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department requesting authorities ""urgently and swiftly"" develop a lending facility for mortgage servicers.   ""You would see widescale failures within the servicing system,"" said Ed Mills, Washington analyst at Raymond James. ""That would raise real questions about the plumbing of the housing finance system going forward.""  Fed doesn't want 'chaos' The Fed has made clear it's willing to invoke emergency powers to prevent a credit crisis.  The US central bank has already agreed to buy commercial paper, short-term debt issued by large companies. And the Fed announced plans to set up an entity to buy corporate bonds. And it has promised to buy an unlimited amount of mortgage bonds.  Analysts expect the Fed will announce a facility to lend to mortgage servicers soon after the stimulus bill is enacted. ""This is not the type of chaos that we believe the Federal Reserve would want right as it is trying to calm down markets,"" Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.   ""It is not contentious,"" Seiberg wrote. ""We believe it enjoys bipartisan support.""  He said that this facility was not explicitly included in the stimulus package because the Fed doesn't need legislation to step in.   Powell signals unlimited lending The Fed declined to comment. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized Thursday there is no limit to the central bank's willingness to provide credit to the economy.  ""When it comes to this lending, we're not gonna run out of ammunition,"" Powell told NBC. ""That doesn't happen.""  Although the big bank mortgage servicers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) could borrow from the Fed's discount window to make the mortgage payments, nonbanks like Mr. Cooper and Quicken Loans don't have that option.  ""There's not one nonbank servicer in the industry that can make these payments,"" said Bray, the Mr. Cooper CEO.  Unlike the rescues of the airline and aerospace industries, mortgage executives emphasized this would not be a bailout. The cash advances from the Fed would be repaid when the mortgages are paid off or refinanced.   ""We're looking for assistance. This is not a bailout,"" Bray said. ""This money is not coming into our company for payroll. It's making the borrowers' payments.""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/business/grocery-stores-shopping-coronavirus-grocery-outlet/index.html,Why the 'TJMaxx of groceries' is succeeding during the coronavirus pandemic,"Grocery Outlet (GO), an ""extreme value"" supermarket chain with around 350 stores, mostly on the American West Coast, is capitalizing on shoppers stockpiling groceries during the outbreak and the havoc across supply chains. The grocer, which does not sell online, went public last year and sells its products 40% below conventional supermarket prices. It said Tuesday that sales at stores open for at least one year increased 5.1% during its most recent quarter. Like other grocers and retailers that have stayed open during this crisis, Grocery Outlet's sales accelerated in March as the virus spread across the country. The company also drew new customers to stores. Grocery Outlet ""will be able to turn many of these new shoppers into repeat shoppers,"" Oliver Chen, analyst at Cowen, said in a research report.  Grocery Outlet's business model is a lot like TJX (TJX), the parent company of TJMaxx and Marshalls, and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). This may put it in a strong position to succeed during the crisis and beyond, analysts say. The company relies on an ""opportunistic buying"" strategy to secure items from suppliers, many of whom are the country's top consumer product and food manufacturers.  When a grocery, convenience or drug store cancels an order from manufacturers, a manufacturer produces too much of an item, or a supplier changes product packaging, Grocery Outlet's buyers step in to scoop up the extra inventory. ""Our buying strategy is deliberately flexible to allow us to react to constantly changing opportunities,"" the company says in filings. During the coronavirus pandemic, producers are ramping up their supply to meet overwhelming demand. Food and consumer product manufacturers are also changing up their production lines and packaging to get shipments out more quickly. There's a huge amount of supply chain disruption going around right now, and this imbalance between supply and demand is a positive for Grocery Outlet's business, ""Disruption is a positive in the long run,"" Grocery Outlet President RJ Sheedy told analysts Tuesday. ""Non-traditional suppliers"" have recently approached Grocery Outlet, such as food service companies who don't have restaurants to sell to during the crisis, health and nutrition companies that don't have as many gyms open, and suppliers that sell to retailers that have closed. The company predicts that there will be excess inventory in the market once demand returns to normal. ""This should create opportunity for us long-term to continue to buy great brands at significant discounts,"" Sheedy said in a statement to CNN Business.  Discount clothing companies like TJMaxx may benefit from similar dislocation in the market, too. Traditionally, when there is a glut of clothing available, these chains have more options to step in and scoop it up at lower prices to sell at their stores. ""We also expect ample product availability in the wake of COVID-19,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Kate Fitzsimons said in a research note upgrading TJX's stock this week.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/panic-buying-how-stores-restock-coronavirus/index.html,How grocery stores restock shelves in the age of coronavirus,"""Saturday was really, really busy,"" Leonard, the CEO and president of Stew Leonard's, a grocery store chain with seven locations across New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, said. ""Everybody was exhausted after Saturday.""  Sunday was a day to take stock of what was left in his supermarkets. As soon as they were back in order, Leonard had to prepare for another busy day. Before his stores opened on Monday morning, there were lines of people waiting to get in.  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Leonard has seen spikes in customer visits. After a recent presidential address about the outbreak, people swarmed his stores, he said. When the stock market crashed and rumors spread about closures and restrictions in New York and New Jersey, the same thing happened.  As Americans grow more nervous about the implications of the global pandemic, and as the government puts extraordinary limitations on public life, customers across the country have been clearing supermarkets like Stew Leonard's of essential items. Toilet paper is out. Paper towels are out. Hand sanitizer has been out for weeks. Shoppers are snapping up nonperishable items like canned goods and cereal and emptying shelves of fresh staples like milk, meat and bread.  It's not unusual for grocery stores to see a run on items during times of crisis. People stock up ahead of hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. But natural disasters don't affect all of America, much less the world.  Food demand in retail locations is at ""unprecedented levels,"" said Morris Cohen, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school. ""There will be spot shortages caused by panic buying,"" he noted.  But if you go into a grocery store right now and don't see what you want, that doesn't mean that what you want isn't out there somewhere.  People aren't eating more food. They're just eating it at home. Empty shelves mean there's a bottleneck, not a shortage. Food that had been destined for restaurants, bars, offices and other gathering places will need to go to homes instead, and the system will have to account for the increased volume of groceries Americans cooking at home are suddenly buying.  But the supply chain is built for some disruption, and there's cushioning for it. Our food system can deal with the current demand; it just has to relearn how to distribute the supply.  As long as farmers can keep farming, truckers can keep driving, packaging can be made and supplied and grocery stores can stay open, the empty shelves should be just a temporary inconvenience. A major break in that system, however, could cause real trouble.  A network, not a chain The current surge in demand may be unprecedented, but supply chains are built to react to disruptions. A bad crop yield or a factory fire could lead retailers to swap suppliers or turn to alternative products. Those types of behind-the-scenes impacts aren't rare. But they are rarely seen by consumers.  Major supermarket chains and retailers have networks that stretch into suppliers all over the world, Cohen said. If there are shortages from one supplier, they can turn to another.  To think about how supply chains work, it's best not to imagine a physical chain, Cohen explained. Instead, picture a network: ""If one pathway is broken, if one link in it is severed, there are alternative paths.""  Though Stew Leonard's is a fraction of the size of national grocery chains like Publix or others, Leonard also relies on a network for his products. That has helped him avoid running out of fresh food at his stores.  ""We have had to switch over to other suppliers"" for fresh staples like milk and meat, Leonard said. ""What we've been able to do is get plenty of butter, eggs and milk. Meat we've had no problem,"" he said.   Greg Ferrara, president and CEO of the National Grocers Association, which represents about 21,000 independently-owned grocery stores in the United States, said that his members have seen an ""astronomical"" surge in demand.  ""However,"" he added, ""the shelves do have product. They are stocked. They are getting restocked on a regular basis. The supply chain in this country is very efficient and it's very effective."" Over time, and if the situation persists, some food could be diverted from certain vendors to others. Food that had been shipped to corporate and university cafeterias, cruise lines, airlines and restaurants could instead be sent to grocery stores and retailers.  Some companies are already starting to make adjustments. Baldor, a New York City firm which sells food to restaurants, schools and other food service outlets, is now offering delivery to individuals.  The existing supply ""has to be reallocated,"" said Cohen. ""There has to be an efficient way of doing that. And that could be a challenge because this is going outside the normal structure of how business is conducted."" But, he noted, eventually a balance should be reached.  Shelf-stable goods makers react  As people rush to buy canned food and other nonperishable items, big consumer goods companies are trying to meet demand without needlessly ratcheting up production.  Bumble Bee Foods, which sells canned fish, ""has seen a spike in demand,"" President and CEO Jan Tharp told CNN Business in an email. ""We are in constant communication with both our suppliers and customers and have been successful at keeping up with the accelerated sale of our products.""  General Mills, which sells a vast portfolio of well-known brands like Cheerios, Annie's snacks and pasta and Progresso soups, among others, is seeing ""a short-term increase in customer orders in the US,"" said Kelsey Roemhildt, corporate communications manager for the company. Demand for soup, cereal, snacks and dry baking mixes in particular has gone up. To help meet that spike, General Mills is taking steps like increasing production of some items.  ""Up until this point, the supply chain has been working remarkably well,"" CEO Jeff Harmening said during a discussion of the company's third quarter financial results Wednesday. ""Food continues to flow, we continue to make it. Our retailers continue to stock as quickly as they can. And that all is actually working pretty well.""  Harmening added that ""we anticipate continuing production"" as usual, noting that the company is encouraging social distancing at work and taking other measures to try to keep employees safe.  Still, some disruptions are inevitable.  Nestlé, which sells frozen meals, bottled water, baby food, cereal, chocolate and other items, warned of delays in Europe because of border closures. But the company noted that in the United States, supply is ""relatively insulated"" because most ingredients are locally sourced. ""Our factory, warehouse and distribution centers remain open, with additional measures in place to ensure the safety of our employees and business partners,"" a Nestlé spokesperson said.  And companies have to be careful about dramatically increasing production.  People only need so much of toilet paper or shelf-stable goods. Eventually, they'll start dipping into their own supplies rather than shopping for more, and demand will fall. Any manufacturers that hire more employees or open new facilities because they see the higher demand as a new normal could pay a price.   There's a name for that phenomenon, explained Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at the Harvard Business School. It's called the ""bullwhip effect.""   ""Everybody who works in supply chain just rues the day when this bullwhip effect gets started,"" he said. ""And that's in fact what we're seeing now."" The bullwhip effect is one reason it's important to tamp down panic buying, and try to prevent people from purchasing more than they need.  Rationing supply   Facing the surge in demand, grocery stores and retailers are limiting sales of certain items to try to prevent panic shopping and hoarding, and give them a chance to restock shelves. Walmart said that some items, including cleaning supplies and paper products, are in high demand. It is working to restock those products quickly by sending deliveries directly to stores and prioritizing shipments to certain regions. The chain has instructed store managers to limit sales on high-demand items at their discretion. Kroger is capping purchases of cold, flu and sanitary products. In a message to customers, CEO Rodney McMullen said that the company's supply chain teams are trying to make sure that items are available as soon as possible.  Publix is also limiting the purchase of certain items, as is H-E-B. ""Panic does not promote progress,"" the Texas chain said in a release, adding that customers should come back if they don't find what they need the first time. There are companies that may be weighing whether it makes sense to increase production in order to avoid the bullwhip effect. But others may not have that option. Some toilet paper makers say they'd been running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week as their normal practice. For them, ramping up production would be all but impossible, even if they wanted to.  Farmers who raise dairy cows or cattle or grow produce are in similar situations. They can't immediately grow more crops or milk more cows. And they may not have to -— they just have to figure out where to ship their products. And their farms must continue to function.  Support for farmers   A resilient supply chain should be able to withstand shocks. But it needs enough food in the system to work.  So far, our fresh food supply has avoided major disruptions.  Jim Mulhern, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, offered a reassuring perspective on dairy production.  ""Dairy supplies aren't experiencing production interruptions at this time,"" he said in a statement Monday. ""The US food-supply chain is more than capable of meeting demand.""  Before the crisis hit, US farmers were on track to produce record amounts of poultry, beef, pork and milk, said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents farmers.  And the food should be safe to eat. The USDA has said it is ""not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.""  Zippy Duvall, the Farm Bureau's president, said he's not worried about the short term — but he has concerns about what could happen months from now.  ""There's no crisis in the food supply right now,"" he told CNN Business. ""Our concern is what's going to come six months later.""   A number of factors could threaten the food supply moving forward.  Tyson, one of the world's largest meat producers, warned in a recent SEC filing that ""if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations may be negatively impacted.""   If farmers get sick or have to significantly alter the way they work because of safety measures, the food supply could take a hit. If transportation systems break down, or if truckers are unable to deliver products, our access to the food those farmers grow could be threatened.  Duvall is particularly concerned over a recent decision by the federal government to suspend immigrant visa services in Mexico, another attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Farmers rely on immigrant labor, and Duvall worries that the changes will affect harvesting in the spring and planting in the summer. He recommended that the administration classify farm workers as emergency workers on applications for temporary agricultural work visas.  ""Empty shelves can be frightening, but empty fields and barns would be devastating,"" he warned. Duvall noted that he has been pleased with the Trump administration's efforts to help farmers so far.  For now, however, the system is working.  ""The supplies are there,"" Newton said. ""The key is making sure that the supply chain remains very strong, and the key component of that strong supply chain is access to labor.""  ",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html,"Unemployment claims soared to 3.3 million last week, most in history","Initial jobless claims soared to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ended March 21, according to the Department of Labor.  That is the highest number of initial jobless claims in history, since the Department of Labor started tracking the data in 1967. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2, 1982. ""Most historical comparisons of this scale are inadequate.The closest would be natural disasters like major hurricanes. However, as today's report shows, the coronavirus outbreak is economically akin to a major hurricane occurring in every state around the country for weeks on end,"" Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao wrote in emailed comments. Last week's jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week. Prior to the pandemic, initial claims had been hovering in the low 200,000s each week, reflecting a strong job market. But in the last couple weeks, the coronavirus outbreak has forced many businesses to suddenly shut down as the country tries to slow the spreading virus. For many businesses that also means laying off or furloughing workers, at least temporarily. That is the key difference between the coronavirus shock compared with past periods of economic distress: it is sudden and impacts virtually every industry and business model around.  As a result, economists are expecting millions of job losses in the coming weeks. Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist for the US Department of Labor who is now with the Economic Policy Institute, called the surge in unemployment claims just the tip of the iceberg. ""We estimate that by summer, 14 million workers will lost their jobs due to the coronavirus shock,"" she said in a tweet.  Economists now expect the US economy to fall into a recession in the second quarter, before staging a comeback later in the year after the spread of the virus slows. Meanwhile, state labor departments across the country are have struggled to deal with the sudden influx in claims for unemployment benefits. The New York Labor Department, for example, has added server capacity and hired more than 65 additional staff to handle all the claims that are suddenly pouring in. And last week, Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity said it planned to hire 100 extra staff to help answer calls and walk people through the application process. Speaking later on Thursday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin downplayed last week's surge in unemployment claims in an interview with CNBC, calling the numbers ""not relevant"" because they pre-dated an economic relief bill passed by Congress on Wednesday. That bill includes support for workers, including checks from the government and expanded unemployment benefits.  He added businesses ""hopefully will be able to hire back a lot of those people.""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/us/flight-attendant-coronavirus-death/index.html,"A flight attendant dies, and colleagues are 'very much on edge'","Paul Frishkorn, a longtime union representative and Philadelphia-based flight attendant for American Airlines, died this week, the airline confirmed Wednesday in a statement to CNN.  Authorities in Pennsylvania have yet to release a cause of death. But in the voicemail greeting on his phone, Frishkorn said he was ""very ill"" and awaiting results of a test for Covid-19. ""He was amazing, and totally selfless, and just a ... good soldier who never asked for any recognition, other than to make sure people were taken care of,"" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, told CNN in a phone interview, her voice breaking with emotion. Frishkorn was in his 60s. He had twice been named one of American's Flight Service Champions for excellent customer service. ""Our hearts go out to Paul's family and friends, many of whom work for American,"" the airline said. ""We are working directly with Paul's family to ensure they are cared for during this extraordinarily difficult time."" CNN was unable to reach any of Frishkorn's relatives. About 119,000 Americans work as flight attendants, according to a 2018 estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The coronavirus pandemic has placed them in the same dilemma as millions of other workers: Go to work and risk getting severely ill, or stay home and worry about your paycheck. ""They're right there exposed on the front lines,"" said Lori Bassani, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union representing about 27,000 flight attendants at American Airlines. ""They're scared of getting sick and carrying the virus to their families."" Tracy Sear, a flight attendant for American Airlines, said Frishkorn was a larger-than-life presence who enjoyed figure skating and loved to laugh. But even as she fondly remembered Frishkorn, she thought of other coworkers with elderly or immunocompromised relatives. ""Flight attendants are very much on edge right now,"" she said, because social distancing is so difficult in the close quarters of an airplane cabin. In response to an inquiry from CNN, American Airlines released a statement on worker safety.  ""We've taken enhanced steps to provide our team members with a safe, healthy and clean working environment,"" it said, adding that employees have been told to stay home if they're showing any sign of illness.  The company provides up to two weeks of additional paid sick leave if an employee is diagnosed with the virus or put under quarantine by a health official.  ""If a team member doesn't feel comfortable coming to work,"" the airline said, ""we are encouraging them to take vacation, sick time or leave."" James Rhoades, a longtime flight attendant based in North Carolina, told CNN he developed a dry cough while at work for an airline last week. After going home, he had a fever, excruciating headaches and shortness of breath. Rhoades is 55, with stents in his heart. At home on Wednesday, as he waited for coronavirus test results, he reflected on his recent weeks in the air. Most flights are emptier than usual, he said, but some people are buying cheap tickets and going on vacation. He saw full planes heading to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Grand Cayman and the Bahamas. On a layover in San Antonio, he saw tourists crammed together outside the Alamo. Flight attendants have no way to hide from the virus, he said. They share bathrooms with passengers. They sit together on jump seats, shoulders touching. And even when Rhoades found an empty corner of the plane, he says, a passenger walked over and coughed on him.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/economy/global-economy-coronavirus-bailout/index.html,The bill for saving the world economy is $7 trillion and rising ,"The response to the coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in terms of speed and scale. Commitments from governments and central banks to date are close to $7 trillion, according to an analysis by CNN Business. The total includes government spending, loan guarantees and tax breaks, as well as money printing by central banks to buy assets such as bonds and stock funds.  The figure includes the $2 trillion US relief package working its way through Congress and an anticipated 30 trillion yen ($274 billion) in stimulus from Japan that could be approved next month. In Europe, CNN Business tallied stimulus efforts by the biggest economies: Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. The combined effort dwarfs the response to the 2008 financial crisis, which smashed records at the time. But economists worry even the Herculean efforts undertaken so far won't be sufficient should the crisis extend beyond June. ""The [$2 trillion US] stimulus package is likely the bare minimum needed to offset the current drag from the outbreak,"" Bank of America economist Joseph Song told clients Thursday. ""The economy will likely need close $3 [trillion] in fiscal stimulus, if not more."" The last time global economic growth was this depressed during peacetime was in 1938, according to Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley's chief economist.  G20 leaders, who represent the world's biggest economies, said Thursday that they stand ready to do ""whatever it takes"" to minimize the economic damage from the pandemic and restore global growth. ""The magnitude and scope of this response will get the global economy back on its feet and set a strong basis for the protection of jobs and the recovery of growth,"" the leaders said in a joint statement after a video conference. They say that their countries have committed to stimulus worth $5 trillion. Yet the vast spending can only blunt some of the economic pain. While unemployment benefits and cutting checks to citizens will provide much needed assistance, the economy can't begin to recover in earnest until bars and restaurants start to reopen, people go back to work and travel resumes. Even then, it will take time, as China is discovering. ""It's not going to be possible to get back to the same level of output and activity immediately,"" Ahya said, noting the lingering effects of a sharp spike in unemployment and battered corporate balance sheets. Here are the highlights from the first wave of central bank and government action. United States US lawmakers are expected to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package later this week. The legislation includes direct payments to individuals, a boost to unemployment benefits and a $500 billion lending program.Congress has already approved more than $112 billion to ramp up vaccine research and provide two weeks of paid sick leave for those who are being tested or treated for Covid-19, the disease cause by the novel coronavirus.The Federal Reserve has let loose a tsunami of stimulus measures in recent days. That includes an initial pledge to purchase $700 billion in US Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which now has no cap and can include corporate bonds and bond exchange-traded funds. The Fed also announced $300 billion in new financing to keep credit flowing to businesses and consumers. United Kingdom The UK government has unveiled £330 billion ($397 billion) in loan guarantees and suspended local business taxes for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors for 12 months. It will also cover 80% of workers' salaries for at least the next three months, up to a maximum of £2,500 ($2,900) a month. It's unclear how much that initiative will cost.In addition, the UK government on Thursday promised to provide the self-employed with a cash grant of 80% of their average monthly profit, up to £2,500 ($3,000) a month, over the next quarter.The Bank of England has said it will increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200 billion ($242 billion). European Union Germany has unveiled a rescue package worth up to €750 billion ($825 billion) that includes measures to spur lending to businesses and take direct stakes in companies.France has approved €45 billion ($50 billion) in relief for small businesses and unemployed workers. It is also guaranteeing  €300 billion ($330 billion) in corporate borrowing.Italy has greenlit €25 billion ($27.5 billion) to help workers and support the country's health system, while Spain has put up €200 billion ($220 billion).The European Central Bank has said it will spend €750 billion ($824 billion) buying government debt and private securities before the end of 2020, and stands ready to do more if necessary. That's on top of €120 billion ($133 billion) in extra purchases it announced previously. China So far, China has announced at least 116.9 trillion yuan ($16.4 billion) in financial relief and stimulus, plus 800 billion yuan ($112.5 billion) in tax and fee reductions. But if necessary, the country could very well spend trillions of dollars and rack up massive amounts of debt to shore up its economy.The People's Bank of China has adopted various credit easing measures, allocating at least 1.15 trillion yuan ($162 billion) to help businesses hit by the virus. Japan The Japanese government is expected to consider an economic stimulus package in the coming weeks that would likely include cash handouts as well as measures to help small and medium-sized companies get access to loans. The package could total 30 trillion yen ($274.2 billion).The Bank of Japan has said it will raise the annual rate of its purchases of exchange-traded funds by 6 trillion yen ($55 billion) and boost the annual rate of purchases of real estate investment trusts by 90 billion yen ($822 million). It also raised the limit for purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds by 2 trillion yen ($18 billion). India The Indian government unveiled a relief package worth $22.6 billion just 36 hours after the country's lockdown was imposed.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/investing/gold-demand-supply-coronavirus/index.html,Want to buy gold coins or bars? Good luck finding any,"But with major gold refineries across Europe shut because of government-ordered lockdowns, online shops out of stock and many of the passenger planes that move bullion grounded, physical gold is becoming harder to track down.  ""There is gold around, it's just either in the wrong location or in the wrong form,"" said Ross Norman, an independent analyst and former senior bullion dealer at Credit Suisse (CS). ""Anyone looking to buy a physical bar or settle a futures contract has an issue."" The strain on supply, due to a lack of transport and processing capacity, has been exacerbated by a surge in demand, as investors rush to buy the safe-haven asset amid the global economic and financial market turmoil. Rob Halliday-Stein, managing director of BullionByPost, the United Kingdom's largest online bullion trader, said sales of gold coins have increased five-fold. ""It's unprecedented,"" he told CNN Business.  The company sells everything from Australian gold nugget coins starting at around £44 ($52) to South African Krugerrands for £1,530 ($1,800) and 1 kilogram gold bars for £48,273 ($56,853).  During uncertain times there's often a flight to gold, because its physical properties make it a good store of value, said Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs (GS). ""It is dense, cheap to store and much easier to move around than a commodity like oil,"" Currie explained. As central banks print huge amounts of euros, pounds and greenbacks, collectively known as fiat currencies, to keep their economies afloat, the intrinsic value of money falls. ""We like to call [gold] the currency of last resort,"" added Currie. ""When fear sets in and policymakers debase the fiat currencies like they are now, the cost of holding gold relative to holding other currencies declines."" BullionByPost anticipated the demand spike and secured extra stock in advance. But Halliday-Stein said investors should be wary of buying gold if it is not yet in the hands of the seller, noting that ""supply chains are creaking"" and it is difficult to predict when more stock will become available. To add to the strain on supply, fewer people are selling gold back to dealers despite the spike in prices. And those who do want to sell are finding it difficult because restrictions on travel and work mean companies such as BullionByPost have pared back their operations, said Halliday-Stein.  Supply shortages The crunch isn't just affecting small investors. The international market is at risk of seizing up too. While London, the global hub for the physical gold trade, has plenty of 400 ounce bars (worth over $420 billion) inside vaults beneath the city, getting those bars to New York in the form in which they are traded there (100 ounce bars) is proving a challenge, with precious metals refineries closed and thousands of passenger flights canceled. Gold traders in the Big Apple are feeling the squeeze. At one point on Tuesday, the difference between the spot price of gold in London — that is, the price of gold for immediate delivery — and futures contracts trading in New York for delivery of gold in April increased to around $100, said Norman, the independent analyst. Gold futures contracts enable buyers and sellers to agree in advance a price to be paid when the gold is delivered in future. Spot gold in London and gold futures in New York normally trade within $1 to $2 of one another, reflecting the costs associated with delivering the gold to New York.  The widening gap indicates that the market is unsure of whether it will be possible to actually deliver the physical gold in April and make good on the contracts. In other words, it is pricing in a supply shortage.   That prompted CME Group (CME), which owns COMEX, the exchange on which these contracts are traded, to announce Tuesday that it would launch a new gold futures contract for April, which allows for delivery in 100 ounce, 400 ounce and 1 kilogram gold bars.  ""This new contract will provide customers with maximum flexibility in managing physical delivery,"" a CME Group spokesperson said, highlighting ""the unprecedented market conditions."" The London Bullion Market Association, the body that sets standards for how precious metals are refined and traded around the world, said it has offered support to CME Group to ""facilitate physical delivery in New York"" and is working closely with COMEX ""to ensure the efficient running of the global gold market."" Gold stocks in London vaults are at a ""healthy"" 8,263 tonnes, the London Bullion Market Association said in a statement.  The difference between spot and futures prices was around $25 on Thursday, suggesting that the market is still struggling to function. ",3/26/2020

""They say don't work if you're sick -- but also say 'do more,'"" said Johnson, who said she qualifies for Medicaid coverage. Johnson said she feels the gig companies are doing the ""absolute bare minimum"" to protect her and others like her.  More money on the table She's not alone in feeling this way. ""A lot of us think, 'I've got the electric bill tomorrow,' or 'I need gas in my car right now so I'm going to take this batch.' It's really ugly,"" added Heidi Carrico, an Instacart worker in Portland, Oregon, who said she does not have health insurance. ""It's a kind of mind-play to encourage workers to work against their own best interest.""  An Instacart spokesperson told CNN Business that the company offers promotions based on certain factors including the market and customer demand. Instacart said it has seen the highest demand in the company's history when it comes to groceries sold in the past week. Due to the increased demand in recent weeks, promotions are more readily available to workers, according to the spokesperson. While many gig workers have long had a contentious relationship with the companies they work for, the issue is perhaps more pressing than ever as lives are quite literally at stake. (Both Johnson and Carrico said they have participated in various organizing efforts for better worker conditions in the past; Carrico is part of a newly formed group called Gig Workers Collective that is fighting for fair pay and better treatment for gig economy workers.) As many people look to delivery services in an attempt to avoid human contact during the pandemic, the companies clearly see a business opportunity.  Some companies are seizing on concerns to market their platforms. ""Staying home? We'll go to the store for you,"" was the subject line of a recent Postmates e-mail to customers, for example. The companies must strike a balance between keeping workers safe and making sure they have enough workers to meet the growing demand.   Gad Allon, a professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who has researched what motivates gig workers, has found that the more gig workers have previously worked, the more likely they are to continue working similar hours. ""In times like this, you want people to be more careful with their health"" ""Specifically in times like this, where you want people to be a little more careful with their health, that actually might not work that well if you incentivize them to keep picking up orders,"" said Allon. He added that, in a time where companies should want workers to be more careful, it might be ""counterproductive"" in terms of health to offer bonuses based on order volume, for example. DoorDash said it is testing an option that allows for ""contactless delivery"" -- something other companies like Instacart and Postmates have recently introduced. While the companies have sent reminders to workers to wash their hands, some restaurants do not allow gig workers like DoorDash and Postmates courier to use their bathrooms.  DoorDash said it has set up an online store for its couriers to order supplies (up to three hand sanitizers and a box of disposable gloves per week) for free but they'll have to pay for shipping costs. The company said the items are available for Dashers to order in over 400 affected cities so far and that it may add additional items.  ""DoorDash's task force is actively working to develop and implement a strategy to protect the health and safety of our community,"" said a DoorDash spokesperson in a statement. ""We have provided and will continue to share the latest public health guidance to consumers, Dashers, and merchants."" In a statement, a Postmates spokesperson said, ""community health and safety is paramount at Postmates, and we continue to issue in-app, precautionary CDC guidance with those carrying out deliveries so that they are aware of the latest preventative measures. We've taken a number of steps to ensure our platform is safe."" Postmates said last week it has set up a Fleet Relief Fund that will ""credit"" the cost of medical checkups related to coronavirus for workers in select markets. Workers can enroll in a health savings account through Postmates to qualify. Low inventory can mean low or no tips While Instacart has touted its surge in customer orders, including that many are stocking up on household essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, workers say the company has done little for those fulfilling those requests.  When customers order through Instacart, they fill up their virtual carts with the items -- but the items might not be available in the physical stores. Some retailers have recently implemented quotas on certain items to prevent hoarding, so delivery workers may not be able to fulfill requests for that reason. ""If I see the offer has a bunch of water, toilet paper, handy wipes, I don't accept it because customers are rating people low because they can't get items that were out of stock or are limited supply,"" said Carrico, noting that low ratings for workers can impact the future orders they receive.  An Instacart spokesperson said that inventory is managed by the retailer, but that its data and predictive technology will notify customers if certain items may be low or out-of-stock so they can select possible replacement items. Sometimes, customers even revoke tips -- something Instacart allows customers to do up to three days after an order -- when unsatisfied with their orders, the workers told CNN Business. Instacart's spokesperson said tips are always left up to the customer's discretion.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/gig-economy-coronavirus-lockdown/index.html,Millions of gig economy workers need help now to make coronavirus lockdowns work,"The dilemma was illustrated Tuesday by images of packed subway cars in London less than 12 hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced stricter social distancing measures as part of a nationwide lockdown.  The new coronavirus restrictions mean people are only allowed to leave their homes for medical reasons, to grocery shop or exercise once a day, and to travel to and from work when absolutely necessary.  In the United States, at least 16 states have issued stay-at-home orders which, once in effect, will impact 142 million people, or 43% of the US population, according to data compiled by CNN. But lockdowns won't be effective if individuals who cannot work from home continue reporting to job sites because not doing so would deprive them of income.  The UK government's pledge to subsidize up to 80% of wages does not apply to the country's 5 million self-employed workers, who have been given limited relief through the tax and welfare systems. The lack of cover has prompted calls for the government to also support gig economy workers. The Trades Union Congress, which represents nearly 50 UK labor unions, said in a statement Monday that existing measures for self-employed people, which include delayed income tax payments and access to up to £94 ($112) a week through the benefits system, are ""clearly not good enough."" The opposition Labour Party has called on the government to urgently extend financial assistance to the self-employed so that ""nobody risks losing their income by staying home."" ""Many of those traveling to work today ... work in the gig economy or are freelancers,"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Tuesday on Twitter. ""A proper package of support for these workers would alleviate this situation and help public transport, and I've raised this with the government,"" he added. Uber (UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Monday urged President Donald Trump to include protections and benefits for independent workers as part of the country's economic stimulus. Some 15.9 million Americans, or 10% of the country's workforce, are self-employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. US laws ""should protect all workers, not just one type of work,"" Khosrowshahi said in a letter to Trump in which he calls on government to consider a longer-term safety net for gig economy workers.  More than 1.3 million Americans work on Uber's platform. The company had 3.9 million drivers worldwide at the end of 2018. It largely views such workers as independent contractors not eligible for benefits.  Uber said in a statement that it is providing drivers and delivery people with financial assistance for up to 14 days if they are diagnosed with the coronavirus or placed into quarantine by a public health authority. By comparison: the UK wage subsidy will run for at least three months.",3/26/2020

Teleworking.  That's what Walmart's executive vice president of corporate affairs Dan Bartlett told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. Later, a spokesman for the company told CNN the same thing. As officials try to control the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of white collar workers — normally bound by dress codes and expectations in the office — are trading business trousers for sweat pants, and stiff blazers for that hoodie they would only ever allow their family, roommates or dog to see. But there's that matter of video conferencing where you still want to present a presentable self to your colleagues. And so, many of us are donning business attire on top and casual clothing from the waist down. ""We're seeing increased sales in tops, but not bottoms,"" Bartlett told Yahoo Finance. ""So, people who are concerned, obviously, from the waist up.""  ""These behaviors are going to continue to change and evolve as people get accustomed to this new lifestyle, if you will."" Asked about the comment, a spokesman for world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer confirmed the executive's assertion.  The data, however, is taken from US sales, the spokesman told CNN.

After initially saying it would suspend all passenger flights, the company amended its statement later Sunday to say it will continue operating passenger flights to 13 destinations in response to ""requests from governments.""   Emirates is also taking a number of other cost-cutting measures, including reducing operations at its air services division, Dnata, and a temporary cut to most employees' basic salaries.  The announcement comes as airlines around the world grapple with a massive loss of business as demand for air travel dries up amid the coronavirus outbreak. Around the world, coronavirus cases have topped 300,000, nearly 13,000 people have died and many countries and local jurisdictions have implemented travel restrictions to stop the spread.  US airlines say they have seen a ""virtual shutdown"" in air domestic travel, and some wonder if federal officials will ground many or all domestic flights. The US airline industry is seeking about $50 billion in federal help to deal with the crisis.  ""The world has literally gone into quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak,"" Emirates Group chairman and CEO HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in the statement.  ""As a global network airline, we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot viably operate passenger services until countries re-open their borders, and travel confidence returns. By Wednesday 25 March, although we will still operate cargo flights which remain busy, Emirates will have temporarily suspended most of its passenger operations,"" he said.  Emirates will continue to operate its international air cargo network to transport ""essential goods including medical supplies"" around the world. Passenger flights will continue to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, South Africa, the United States and Canada ""until further notice, as long as borders remain open,"" Emirates said in its updated statement Sunday.   The company said it is taking steps to protect the health of employees who have to continue coming to work, including enhanced cleaning at its facilities and on its planes, temperature screening at office entry points and providing hand sanitizers and masks to some frontline employees.  In order to further manage costs, the President of Emirates Tim Clark and President of Dnata Gary Chapman plan to take a 100% basic salary cut for three months.  Emirates also plans to cut most employees' basic salaries by 25% to 50% for three months, in what the company said is a move to avoid having to lay off staff. Employees will still receive ""other allowances"" during this time, and junior level employees will be exempt from the salary reduction.  ""Rather than ask employees to leave the business, we chose to implement a temporary basic salary cut as we want to protect our workforce and keep our talented and skilled people, as much as possible,"" Sheikh Ahmed said. ""We want to avoid cutting jobs. When demand picks up again, we also want to be able to quickly ramp up and resume services for our customers.""",3/27/2020

India's Sensex was flat after the Reserve Bank of India announced a slew of new measures to help the economy during the coronavirus crisis, and slashed interest rates. The unease across global markets followed a strong performance from US stocks on Thursday, which climbed despite the worst jobless claims data on record.  Investors remained optimistic as US lawmakers put the finishing touches on a $2 trillion stimulus bill that will provide a boost to the economy.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/perspectives/unemployment-insurance-work-coronavirus/index.html,The best way to help out-of-work Americans right now,"We know from past experience that economic downturns are accompanied by substantial increases in unemployment, as workers are laid off and employers reduce their hiring. This recession will almost certainly feature an especially rapid increase in unemployment, relative to previous recessions. One of the extraordinary — but necessary — realities of the coronavirus crisis is that policymakers are deliberately shutting down economic activity in order to reduce further spread of the virus. We may very well see an unprecedently large and fast surge of unemployment claims in coming days and weeks. It is therefore urgently necessary that we provide financial support to those hurt by the coming recession, and unemployment insurance is one of the best ways of doing so in a targeted way. One of the first lines of defense in any recession is the unemployment insurance (UI) system. The UI system has stabilized the lives of many workers and their families in previous recessions, but it has serious weaknesses that we must remedy now. To make UI more effective in the current crisis, policymakers at the state and federal levels should immediately take the following steps. Eliminate job search requirements The first and most obvious change to be made is eliminating job search requirements. During normal times, unemployment income recipients are required to actively search for (and be ready to take) new employment. Under normal circumstances, this can be a sensible requirement that mitigates any tendency to discourage job seeking. But with the coronavirus leading to a deliberate shutdown of so much economic activity, and hiring likely drying up throughout the labor market, it would be profoundly foolish to insist that unemployment income recipients satisfy the normal job search requirements. These requirements can be temporarily suspended without any negative consequences for economic efficiency. Many states, like Texas and Pennsylvania, have already done this, and the recently passed Emergency Unemployment Insurance Stabilization and Access Act of 2020 has provisions that encourage other states to do similarly.  Expedite payments The second task for policymakers (especially state policymakers) is to remove any roadblocks to unemployment income participation and expedite the issuance of benefits. In Texas, for example, Governor Greg Abbott has ordered that the so-called ""waiting week"" — typically required by Texas law — be suspended, allowing workers to immediately receive benefits after their application is accepted (similar actions have been taken in Massachusetts and other states). For workers who have unexpectedly lost their incomes, this sort of accelerated benefits provision can be vital, and Congress has encouraged states to take action. UI participation can be improved in other ways as well: For example, more states should allow part-time workers to access UI benefits (without necessarily searching for full-time work).   Increase benefit amounts The third imperative is to raise the level of unemployment income benefits for at least the duration of the recession. This should be done by Congress — which is currently considering such a reform — given that states will soon face considerable fiscal pressure from falling revenues and rising spending needs. One option is to raise the replacement rate — the percent of lost wages that UI provides to a recipient — by 25 percentage points (or more) in every state. The replacement rate typically sits between one-third and just above one-half, so this would be a large increase. In the most generous states, unemployment income would then pay about three quarters of lost earnings.  This last reform is especially important for stabilizing the overall economy, particularly once coronavirus restrictions on economic activity are lifted. Other UI reforms, like adding weeks of extended benefits after regular UI is exhausted, are certainly valuable and will be needed. But enhanced UI benefits can help stabilize the economy immediately, whereas extended benefits tends to have a delayed impact.  The time to strengthen the unemployment income system is now, before millions of Americans suffer extended unemployment and lose vitally needed income. These ideas would have an immediate and tangible impact on the lives of those who are suffering the economic fallout of the coronavirus. ",3/27/2020

Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures also pointed lower.  Asian stocks added to strong gains from Tuesday but markets in Europe pared the advance in afternoon trade. The FTSE 100 (UKX) added 1.3% in London, while France's CAC 40 (CAC40) increased 1.2% and Germany's DAX (DAX) shed 1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 (N225) ended the day up 8%, rallying into the close. South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) gained 5.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) increased 4%, while the Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) gained 2.2%.

The full details have yet to be released.

With the exception of valuations, we're not quite there yet. In the meantime, major risks remain — especially on the unemployment front. If joblessness shoots up, Goldman Sachs warns that companies could wind up short on cash as demand falters even more, raising the chances that the recession ""becomes more entrenched."" Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, thinks the $2 trillion stimulus plan will help limit corporate bankruptcies and thus job losses. But the research firm still sees the unemployment rate in the country soaring above 10%, and the economy contracting at an annual rate of as much as 40% between April and June. Capital Economics also thinks that the US government will need to add to its $2 trillion efforts down the line.

Driving the enthusiasm: Nike said that sales in Greater China fell 4% last quarter, after 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. But online sales in the region increased by more than 30%, helping to compensate for the fact that three quarters of its locations were temporarily closed. The company said that nearly 80% have now reopened. ""We're seeing the other side of the crisis in China,"" CEO John Donahoe told analysts Tuesday. UBS analyst Jay Sole said the strength of online sales eases some concerns about cash flow and will put Nike in a better place than expected when the crisis ends.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/investing/cash-corporate-america-stimulus/index.html,There's a simple way Apple and other companies can help the economy,"Politicians in Washington are stepping up to the plate, too. Congress is reportedly close to approving a financial aid package to help struggling consumers and businesses.  Another leg of stimulus could potentially come from Corporate America. Companies can (and should) help the economy by putting their ample cash reserves to work. Companies have a lot of cash, and many of them are starting to realize that they can put it to work for better use than simply rewarding shareholders with stock buybacks and dividends: They can support their workers and other Americans too.  Big businesses have a lot of cash on hand Non-financial companies in the United States (i.e. companies excluding banks) have more than $1.5 trillion or so in cash on their balance sheets, according to analysis from Moody's from late last year. That's a lot to work with. If that is used to help people struggling from the coronavirus outbreak (i.e. employees, rather than investors), then that could go a long way toward keeping the US economy afloat in the midst of the pandemic. Blue chip American firms such as Facebook (FB), CVS (CVS), Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Kroger (KR) are among several that have already announced bonuses for some of their workers. ""It's unprecedented. So Corporate America stimulus makes sense on a case-by-case basis,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman. Much of the stimulus could come from the tech industry. After all, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook, Cisco (CSCO), and Oracle (ORCL) had nearly half of the cash -- about $638 billion of it -- that Moody's cited in its report. Companies (like Apple) that still have a lot of cash sitting overseas should easily be able to bring much of that money back to the United States following tax law changes in 2017 that lowered the tax rate for repatriating offshore assets.  Cisco pointed out in an email to CNN Business that it's already planning to donate $225 million in cash to global nonprofits as well as charities in its corporate backyard to help low-income residents of California's Santa Clara County. And Facebook said it is working closely with vendors to make sure its employees stay safe and healthy. ""Facebook will pay contingent workers that cannot work due to reduced staffing requirements while working from home, when we close an office, when we choose to send an employee home or when they are sick,"" said Facebook spokesman Anthony Harrison in a statement to CNN Business. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Oracle were not immediately available for comment. But several of these companies have already been using their cash to help those in need. In addition to announcing cash bonuses for workers, Facebook has also set aside $100 million for cash grants to small businesses.  Amazon is hiring 100,000 workers for its fulfillment centers to keep up with online shopping demand. And Apple has also announced various cash donations as well as plans to give away industrial face masks to health care workers in the United States and Europe.  It's a start, but Corporate America probably should -- and hopefully will -- do even more. ",3/25/2020

Trump, for instance, repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the seasonal flu. But Hemmer repeatedly failed to simply point out that Covid-19 has a significantly higher mortality rate than the flu. At another point during the interview, Trump said he would ""love"" for the country to ""open by Easter"" on April 12.

Stelter's two cents There should be daily televised White House briefings -- it's a travesty that the Trump W.H. ever cut back on daily Q&A's -- but at this moment in time, the briefings should be led by doctors and scientists. When the briefings veer into Trump rally territory, they lose value and run the risk of actively harming the audience. If misinformation is aired live, the followups and corrections have to be even livelier... FOR THE RECORD -- ""Trump to New York: Drop Dead"" is the title of this piece by NYT opinion columnist Jennifer Senior... (NYT) -- It is essential to keep seeking out high-quality reporting from the frontlines. Like this AP story about NYC hospitals: ""A 'cacophony of coughing' in packed ERs.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-senate-action-coronavirus/index.html,"White House, Senate reach historic $2 trillion stimulus deal amid growing coronavirus fears","""Ladies and gentleman, we are done,"" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland said right before 1 a.m. after leaving Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office following negotiations that have gone around the clock since last Friday. ""We have a deal."" McConnell formally announced the agreement on the Senate floor, saying, ""At last, we have a deal. After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic.""  The majority leader described it as ""a war-time level of investment for our nation,"" and said that the Senate would move to pass it later in the day on Wednesday. The Senate will re-convene at noon. An exact time has not yet been set for the vote.  The full details have yet to be released. But over the last 24 hours, the elements of the proposal have come into sharper focus, with $250 billion set aside for direct payments to individuals and families, $350 billion in small business loans, $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits and $500 billion in loans for distressed companies. The stimulus bill also has a provision that would block President Donald Trump and his family, as well as other top government officials and members of Congress, from getting loans or investments from Treasury programs in the stimulus, according to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office. The package, if it passes Congress, would be the most significant legislative action taken to address the rapidly intensifying coronavirus crisis, which is overwhelming hospitals and grinding much of the economy to a halt.  Schumer called it ""the largest rescue package in American history,"" in remarks on the Senate floor in the early hours of Wednesday morning. ""This is not a moment of celebration -- but of necessity,"" he said.  The plan will deliver a massive infusion of financial aid into a struggling economy hard hit by job loss, with provisions to help impacted American workers and families as well as small businesses and major industries including airlines.  Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser, called the package ""the single largest main street assistance program in the history of the United States"" at a White House briefing on Tuesday. ""This legislation is urgently needed to bolster the economy, provide cash injections and liquidity and stabilize financial markets to get us through a difficult and challenging period in the economy facing us right now,"" Kudlow said.  Under the plan as it was being negotiated, individuals who earn $75,000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1,200 each, with married couples earning up to $150,000 receiving $2,400 -- and an additional $500 per each child. The payment would scale down by income, phasing out entirely at $99,000 for singles and $198,000 for couples without children. While the final bill text hasn't been released, some of the areas have been debated behind closed doors for days. There was intense partisan debate over the $500 billion proposal to provide loans to distressed companies, with $50 billion in loans for passenger air carriers. Democrats contended there was not enough oversight on how the money would be doled out, but the Trump administration agreed to an oversight board and the creation of an inspector general position to review how the money is spent.  Negotiators also discussed providing four months of unemployment benefits, extending to self-employed workers. Also, the bill would ensure the Small Business Administration could serve as a guarantor for loans of up to $10 billion for small businesses to ensure they can maintain their payrolls and pay off their debts. In addition, the bill would provide a major amount of funding for hard-hit hospitals -- $130 billion -- as well as $150 billion for state and local governments that are cash-strapped due to their response to combat coronavirus. After two consecutive days of high-profile setbacks -- with Senate Democrats blocking procedural votes on Sunday and Monday over opposition to a bill initially crafted by Senate Republicans -- a deal appeared to be imminent by Tuesday morning.  Top negotiators signaled that many of the issues had been resolved and suggested there could be action on a package later in the day.  Schumer optimistically announced at one point that the Senate was at the two-yard line. But by Tuesday evening, no legislative text had been made public as negotiators continued their work.  Asked on Tuesday evening why negotiators appeared to be having such a hard time closing out the deal, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has served as a point person for the administration in the talks, responded, ""Who says we are having a hard time? It's just a complicated deal. We go through a lot of language."" ""We are getting there,"" he responded. Democrats had argued they wanted to see more safeguards for American workers in the deal and oversight for how funding would be doled out. Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi both signaled on Tuesday that they had won concessions in the emerging deal to that end.  Pelosi said in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Tuesday that ""many of the provisions in there have been greatly improved because of negotiation,"" while Schumer said the legislation will have ""unemployment insurance on steroids."" McConnell praised the emerging deal as a win for Republicans as well, saying, ""We are close to a bill that takes our bold Republican framework, integrates further ideas from both parties and delivers huge progress."" Once a deal is released, the next question will be how quickly it can be approved by both chambers -- a challenge made more daunting by the fact that Congress is now operating in a scenario where several of its members have tested positive for coronavirus while many more have self-quarantined after contact with infected individuals.  Pelosi suggested on Tuesday that she is hoping to avoid bringing the full House back to Washington to vote on the package, seeking to pass it through unanimous consent instead. But any individual member can block such a move, creating uncertainty over whether that will be feasible.  Another option may be for the House to approve the package by voice vote as opposed to holding a recorded roll call vote.  House Republicans are falling in line behind the Senate stimulus plan and are willing to allow quick passage of the plan, according to a source on the GOP whip team. After conferring with the various factions of the House GOP Conference, the source said that it is a ""possible outcome"" for the House to voice vote the package when the chamber eventually considers it.  Pelosi has called for the bill to be approved by unanimous consent, but the GOP source said that ""it's a very real possibility"" that a member would object, preventing that from happening.  Pelosi is also open to allowing the bill to pass by a voice vote, which would allow the presiding officer to rule in favor of the side that has the most voice votes. However, members could request a recorded, roll call vote, which would require the full House to return to pass the bill, something lawmakers are eager to avoid amid the coronavirus outbreak.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/media/olympics-nbc-coronavirus/index.html,What postponing the Summer Olympics means for NBC,"The decision, announced Tuesday, has wide-ranging ramifications for the sports world as well as for NBC, the network that has become synonymous with the event. The Olympics, which were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9 in Tokyo, are both a global athletic competition and a major television event in which NBC and its parent company, Comcast (CMCSA), are heavily invested.  NBC has aired every summer Olympics since 1988. Postponing this year's games disrupts multiple parts of NBC, from its ad revenue business to the promotion of Peacock, the network's new streaming service. ""This is significant to NBC because they've built their brand around it. They're the network of the Olympics,"" said Jay Rosenstein, a former vice president of programming at CBS Sports. ""The peacock is intertwined with the Olympic rings."" Rosenstein added that nearly every part of NBC is involved with putting together the games, including its sports, news and cable divisions. ""This is much more than just a two week operation for them. They have to prepare for it for years. Pausing and restarting it is a big challenge,"" Rosenstein told CNN Business. ""It's also an additional challenge because the Beijing Winter Games in 2022 would likely only be six months later now."" Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive, said that the Olympics are a ""top five investment for Comcast.""  ""Every two years the whole company goes all in to present one of the world's unifying premiere events,"" Crakes told CNN Business. ""It's the equivalency of turning around an aircraft carrier to do this all again next year."" The games are a huge advertising and ratings driver. NBC's viewership for the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics were sluggish from previous games, but the games still brought in a big viewership and profits. NBC Sports announced earlier this month that it exceeded $1.2 billion in ad sales for the upcomng Olympics — a new record for the games. ""I'd guess that many of these major sponsors, who have been Olympic sponsors for years, can switch to next year,"" Crakes said. ""It's not easy, but not impossible either."" He added that ""postponing is better than canceling."" However, from a technical and capital investment perspective, putting on the games next year is an ""enormous amount of work.""  ""You have have to rebook all the hotel rooms, you have re-schedule everything,"" he said. ""It's a lot of little things that begin to add up in a big way."" Brian Roberts, Comcast's CEO, said earlier this month that he was ""optimistic"" that the Olympics would take place as scheduled, but  added that the company is insured if the games are interrupted or canceled by the outbreak. ""Should there be some disruption, as others have said, we anticipate these kind of things,"" Roberts said, adding that that the company also has ""insurance for any of the expenses we make."" NBC Sports said on Tuesday that it fully understands the decision to postpone the games.  ""We have no doubt that the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee will put on an exceptional games next year and the Olympic flame will once again unite the world and provide a light at the end of this tunnel,"" an NBC Sports spokesperson said in a statement. Apart from the revenue from the games, NBC also will lose a giant promotional tool for its new streaming service, Peacock. Peacock is set to debut nationally on July 15, a week before the games  were set to begin. The Olympics were to be a big presence on the service, which was going to broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies as well as three daily highlight shows. ""NBC would have loved to use the games to launch the service, but it'll be set up next year and will likely be more than ready to take on the 2021 games,"" Crakes said. Another silver lining for NBC is that there may be a pent up demand for  the games when they finally do occur, according to Rosenstein. ""I don't have a crystal ball, but after all of this audiences may be looking forward to the world coming together next year,"" he said.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/tech/mental-health-tech-coronavirus/index.html,Anxious about the pandemic? Here's how you can get help without leaving home,"On Monday, Schaller, who is based in Michigan, said she texted with about a dozen people over the course of three hours -- all of them reached out about the coronavirus outbreak. Some expressed concerns about being ""stuck at home"" with parents they aren't close to; others discussed how to tackle their anxiety related to being isolated all day. Crisis Text Line is a non-profit text-based hotline intended for people experiencing suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, stress and anxiety. It's one of the many digital options people are turning to as the coronavirus, or COVID-19, continues to spread. All 50 US states are now reporting confirmed cases. While Crisis Text Line is intended for people in crisis, and not as a replacement for therapy or friendship, there are a handful of other services, including therapy apps such as Talkspace, self-care apps like Shine and meditation apps including Headspace, that are also taking note of the rise in anxieties around finances, the health of loved ones and isolation caused by coronavirus.  They're launching new features, discounts and tools to help at a time when in-person therapy options and other self-care outlets are more limited as US businesses temporarily close and more people are urged to stay home.  People can text CRISIS to 741741 to connect with counselors, who work remotely, around the clock, These volunteers have ""always been at home on the couch, in their jammies,"" CEO Nancy Lublin, who founded Crisis Text Line in 2013, told CNN Business.  Lublin said that while the service most often has people under the age of 18 texting in, it's now experiencing an increase in the number of adults seeking support. The organization has especially seen outreach from people who are concerned about paying bills and feel responsible for the well-being of older parents, she added.  The non-profit is also ""watching for"" an uptick in outreach from people experiencing child abuse or domestic violence as they find themselves stuck inside households with abusers, Lublin said. Meanwhile, at Talkspace, therapists are fielding a range of questions from how best to talk to an employer about coronavirus to what is a reasonable amount of worry. The company recently launched a therapist-led support group on Facebook where individuals can seek guidance, tips and resources from professionals, and features a COVID-19 section on its Instagram account where therapists answer questions daily.  While pricing for Talkspace's unlimited text therapy service starts at $65 per week, the company is giving discounted pricing to any new customer for the first month. Along with meditation app Headspace, it's offering its service free to impacted healthcare workers. Simple Habit is providing free meditations sessions for all that are designed to relieve stress. It is also offering free premium app subscriptions through April -- a plan that typically costs $11.99 per month -- for those financially impacted by the pandemic, including those who've lost their jobs. New support is coming online, too. Last week, self-care startup Shine launched a website in 48 hours called VirusAnxiety.com, after seeing a spike in people consuming content around anxiety within the Shine app.  The site, which is in partnership with nonprofit Mental Health America, features audio meditations, articles about isolation, financial fears and xenophobia, as well as an ""Ask An Expert"" section. Some recent examples: ""I'm not worried about getting sick, but worried about giving it to others. Should I self-quarantine?"" and ""My wedding is planned for April. How can I better sit with the uncertainty?""  ""We're here in this complete state of unprecedented anxiety,""  said Shine co-founder and co-CEO Marah Lidey. ""Nothing will really be the same for awhile."" Lidey said she's encouraged by the number of people recognizing they need help to get through this time. ""Community is important; connection is important,""she said. ""But [so is] getting to the right resources.""",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/business/work-from-home-setups-coronavirus-trnd/index.html,People are getting creative with their work-from-home setups,"Some have set up their office on their beds. Others have migrated to kitchen tables or their couches. Many are trying to figure out how to maintain some normalcy while sharing small spaces with partners or family members.  And in the absence of proper work-from-home infrastructure (like, you know, an actual desk), a lot of people are getting creative. The liquor cabinet desks Emma Northcott, who is based in London, is using her liquor cabinet   while she waits for a desk that she ordered online to come in.  Patrick Gipson in New York had a similar idea.  Clearly, they won't have to travel far for (virtual) happy hour. The ironing board desks Bex Holland, who lives in Brighton, England, and some of her colleagues at the game development company Unity have been using ironing boards as standing desks. The clothes hamper desk Jules Forrest, who lives in a studio apartment in San Francisco with her partner, has set up a chair in front of the front door. Her desk? A clothes hamper.  The baby high chair desk Ian Giatti is the digital managing editor for the CBS affiliate in Los Angeles and says the transition to working remotely has been pretty smooth so far. But he's had to improvise at times. His standing desk is a baby high chair.  ""I'm a dad of 3 young kids, so that's been challenging at times when I'm on a call or something's breaking,"" he told CNN. ""Thank God for my wife."" The bathtub desks Scott Lagstrom from Morrisville, North Carolina, is working from his bathtub. ""Working in the tub as the walls close in with two parents working from home and three kids off school. Ha!"" his wife Allison Lagstrom writes.  He's not the only one working from the tub. Amanda Epstein and her husband, who live with their 18-month-old in a Manhattan apartment, are both attorneys working from home. But they have only one desk with a monitor. ""So my handy husband used our soaking tub, a mini-ironing board on which he can put his laptop, and a kitchen chair to create a second workspace in the master bath,"" Epstein writes. The toilet desk Lesley Grubb, a director of production at TBS and TNT based in Atlanta, took two conference calls and a teleconference from her home office, as evidenced below.  ""The only spot in my house where you can't hear my 4 kids, ages 5-9 :),"" she writes. The closet office The desk in Jessica Fleming's home in Minnesota is in an open area -- not an ideal space for virtual meetings when you have kids in the house.  She turned the closet in her master bedroom into a makeshift office, so she has a quiet space to take conference calls and to focus.  ""The best part?"" she writes. ""I've even hung a picture behind the desk so that my video conference calls don't look like I'm in my closet!"" The ladder desk Heidi Floyd is a keynote speaker and with in-person events being canceled or moved online because of the virus, she's had to find a way to keep things going. Enter the ladder desk. Here she is in Atlanta delivering a keynote address to a group of people in the Quad Cities, a region of five cities in Iowa and Illinois. ""Not pictured is my son, who was laying at the door whispering (loudly), 'MAMA don't step on my legos! MAMA!!'"" Floyd writes. The SUV office Joseph Kim, who works in strategy for a software company, says he was getting cabin fever in the small San Francisco condo he shares with his wife, who is also working from home.  So, he set up a workspace in his SUV, and his dog Chewy joined too. ""I love being outside so this gives me flexibility to get some fresh air,"" he writes. The playroom desk Jody Striegel's home office in Skokie, Illinois, doesn't have a door -- and with a 4-year-old and 8-year-old in the house, things can get pretty noisy. That sometimes means working from the playroom. The ping pong table desk Jill Freed, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, works for a commercial insurance company. Her kitchen and living room are being remodeled, so the family is currently living in the basement.  ""We've gotten very good at using flat surfaces in fun ways as our air hockey table is currently the pantry.  The ping pong table was just sitting there not being used, so I decided to get creative!"" But working remotely is not without is own joys. She even managed to play a little coffee pong.  The setups that put the rest of us to shame Bree Bosse Mavity, an elementary school teacher at the Marietta Center for Advanced Academics in Georgia, converted her craft space into an office and virtual classroom. But she's also caring for her young daughter, as evidenced by the play area next to her chair. ""Having a dedicated space is important so that I can work efficiently to support my students and their families while also caring for my 4-month-old daughter,"" she told CNN. Tracy Williams, a media paraprofessional at Marietta Center for Advanced Academics and the wife of one of our producers, works in an elementary school library.  Since she's having to do video lessons with students, she created a Harry Potter themed backdrop.  ... and then there's Steve Strehl's desk Geologist Steve Strehl, who works in Seattle, might have one-upped us all with his fieldwork desk.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/tech/netflix-internet-overload-eu/index.html,Netflix and YouTube are slowing down in Europe to keep the internet from breaking,"Both companies said the measures will affect all video streams for 30 days. ""We estimate that this will reduce Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25% while also ensuring a good quality service for our members,"" a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. A spokesperson for Google (GOOGL), which owns YouTube, said: ""We will continue working with member state governments and network operators to minimize stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience."" The changes follow appeals from EU officials for streaming services and individual users to ditch high definition video to prevent the internet from breaking. With so many countries on forced lockdowns to fight the spread of the virus, hundreds of millions working from home and even more children out of school, the officials were concerned about the huge strain on the internet. European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who is responsible for the EU internal market covering more than 450 million people, spoke to Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings on Wednesday and again on Thursday about the strain video streaming was placing on networks.  In a statement on Thursday Breton said that given the unprecedented situation, streaming platforms, telecom operators and users ""all have a joint responsibility to take steps to ensure the smooth functioning of the internet during the battle against the virus propagation.""  According to a 2019 report by American networking equipment company Sandvine, video accounts for over 60% of data delivered from internet providers to consumers, with Netflix accounting for just under 12% of total  traffic. Google traffic, driven by YouTube, accounts for another 12%. A Netflix spokesperson told CNN Business the reduction may mean some users ""see a reduction in perceptible video quality,"" while others won't see any change. A spokesperson for Amazon (AMZN) said it has also begun efforts to reduce streaming bitrates on its Prime Video service, and was working with authorities to help mitigate network congestion. The Commission said that while there has been a sharp increase in internet usage, no outages or adverse effects have so far been reported. EU officials said they would work with the regulator that oversees electronic communications in the bloc to set up a special reporting mechanism to monitor internet traffic and respond to capacity issues. Telecom operators said they support calls for customers to switch to standard definition streaming. ""At this stage, new traffic patterns are being effectively handled by engineers as per standard network operations,"" Lise Fuhr, director general of the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association, said in a statement. ""We support the European Commission's effort to ensure that national governments and national regulators have all the tools they need to keep networks strong across the continent."" Howard Watson, chief technology and information officer for BT Group (BTGOF), said in a statement that the company ""has more than enough capacity"" in its UK network.  ""Even if the same heavy data traffic that we see each evening were to run throughout the daytime, there is still enough capacity for work applications to run simultaneously,"" he said.  Verizon (VZ) CEO Hans Vestberg also said his company's US network is prepared to handle the traffic.  ""So far [we're seeing] no congestion in the network, we can handle that, we have built a very robust network,"" Vestberg told CNN Business' Richard Quest on Thursday. He did acknowledge that the company is seeing different kinds of demands on the network — including a 75% jump in gaming traffic and a 30% increase in VPN usage from the prior week. But the internet is clearly under pressure.  Facebook (FB) on Wednesday acknowledged that the effects of the pandemic are stretching it to the limit.  In a call with reporters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook's services are facing ""big surges"" in usage as the coronavirus forces millions around the world to stay home.  He described the increase in demand as ""well beyond"" the main annual spike usually seen on New Year's Eve. Voice and video calls on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, in particular, are more than double usual levels.  It's not just extra video streaming that is straining internet infrastructure, said Kin K. Leung, professor of internet technology at Imperial College London. As businesses, schools and universities close down, and millions study and work from home, livestreaming of classes and video conferencing will increase exponentially.  Livestreaming is more demanding on the internet than video streaming, where the data is chopped up into packets that are shipped individually, and buffered, or loaded, separately if necessary to prevent disruption, Leung said. He said he was concerned about the United Kingdom's ability to handle the surge in demand, but confident that everyone will have good access. Just as people are taking steps to avoid unnecessary social contact and practicing better hygiene to help fight the pandemic, so they should think about whether they really need to livestream a lecture, for example, rather than recording it, Leung said. ""Be a bit more conscious about the demand every one of us places on the internet, that is a good step to help out and ease the overload,"" he added. — Joe Sutton in Atlanta contributed to this article.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/nextdoor-coronavirus/index.html,Neighborhood social network Nextdoor is both a lifeline and a hub of anxiety,"""[I] can send pics of toilet paper upon request,"" a post on the neighborhood social network read. ""Willing to negotiate."" Posts like this reflect the present state of Nextdoor, which currently hosts a flurry of hyperlocal news updates about the coronavirus outbreak and serves as a place for people to connect with others in their communities. It's also a virtual hub where anxiety runs high. The company, which launched in October 2011, said it's seen a significant increase in user engagement in the past two weeks (up 80%), especially in areas hit hard by the virus, such as the greater New York City area and Seattle. Nextdoor, which doesn't share its total user numbers, is available in 260,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and many European countries. The number of coronavirus cases in the US continues to climb. On Sunday evening, there were 3,349 confirmed cases. About 24 hours later, that number jumped by more than 1,000. With many actions coming in at a local level, such as the ""shelter in place"" declaration for residents in six counties in California and school closings across the nation, there's a need to quickly find and disperse local information. For myself, living within a one-mile containment center in Westchester County in New York, Nextdoor has been a lifeline. Ahead of national news, I've learned what a containment zone actually means -- unlike a mandated quarantine, individuals who reside or work in the area are not restricted -- and discovered which streets the National Guard is occupying, the stores that still have cleaning products in stock and how the nearby drive-thru coronavirus testing center works.  I've seen Nextdoor posts from volunteers offering to pick up groceries and medicine or run errands for those who are quarantined. Others have advocated for supporting local businesses and people calling for prayers. But I've also encountered a steady flow of fears, whether it's residents who believe the testing center is too far from the zone's epicenter, potentially exposing more areas to the illness, or concerns over how some businesses outside the area are refusing to serve the town. Some conspiracy theories have circulated, too.  Local communities have been gathering on the web for years; whether it's on forums, Facebook Groups, Subreddits or Amazon's Ring network, where neighbors can discuss crime concerns and other topics. More recently, some people like Brooklyn resident Sarah Thankam Mathews have created Slack channels -- typically a workplace tool -- to stay in touch with housebound locals in her Bed-Stuy neighborhood. (She calls the channel, which now has more than 400 people, ""a bright spot in a really difficult time."") But as coronavirus cases increase and more declare states of emergency, the level of panic could surely rise -- and with that, so can the spread of misinformation, or people unknowingly sharing things that are partially false or inaccurate. That's especially a concern for smaller networks. ""Unlike larger social media platforms, there aren't as many moderation guidelines over misinformation on smaller networks, so when you solely rely on the crowd, the opportunity to intervene with correct information decreases and there is a greater potential for misinformation,"" said Ben Decker, who runs the digital investigations consultancy Memetica and follows the spread of misinformation.  Misinformation that gets picked up on Twitter or Facebook could make its way onto Nextdoor before it's removed from the original sites, according to Decker. ""Nextdoor is no less immune to misinformation or disinformation -- and it's probably a bit more concerning than some others because there are likely less safeguards, fact checkers, trusted health professionals and journalists in place who have information that has been confirmed,"" Decker added. Nextdoor declined to comment on the specifics of its safeguards but notes on its site it will ""monitor and take action against false claims and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, including misinformation about fake cures or prevention methods, or any claim that is otherwise harmful to our neighbors and communities."" It also recently rolled out guidelines for users to report misinformation they see on the site and is ""reviewing all content reported to us."" ""Coming together to prevent panic and the spread of misinformation is critical. ... We are committed to doing everything we can to help our members stay safe and have access to accurate, real-time information from trusted health officials,"" the company said in a statement sent to CNN Business.  It said it is also sharing some of this information, such as updates from the CDC, WHO and its partners, to its newsfeed. But not everyone leans on Nextdoor for news and updates -- some have long used it for entertainment; an approach that's leaving Jenn Takahashi, who runs the popular Twitter account @BestofNextdoor, a bit conflicted. For the past two years, Takahashi, a public relations manager for a dating app, has tweeted out amusing posts spotted by Nextdoor users, such as a request for a minister to officiate a cat wedding. ""I grew up in a small town and find some of those small town problems very endearing,"" said Takahashi, who became captivated by Nextdoor when a San Francisco neighbor started complaining daily about strangers touching her garden gnomes. ""But now it's getting complicated."" Takahashi has been uncertain about how to continue bringing laughs to her 365,000 followers -- a number that jumped by 14,000 users in the past few weeks -- as the virus spreads. She recently started tweeting ""a few silly conspiracy theories, such as 5G is linked to COVID-19, because I found that it brought levity to me in this bleak environment."" ""It felt almost inauthentic to be posting about frivolous neighbor drama when everyone is clearly focused on what is happening with the pandemic,"" she added. Nextdoor may be a bit different than it was a few weeks ago, but for many, it's bridging the gap between what's happening outside while we all stay inside.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/success/video-conference-work-from-home/index.html,The rules of video conferencing at home,"With a growing number of companies asking employees to work from home due to coronavirus, video conferencing has allowed workers to continue having meetings. It also satisfies the social interaction many workers start to crave when they are working from home. But it can feel a little awkward letting people get a glimpse into our homes.  Here's what you need to know about remote video conferencing:  Dress casually, but appropriately Follow your company's culture when it comes to your attire for video calls. Some workers will be expected to keep the same attire they wear in the office, while for many others, it's acceptable to dress more comfortably than they usually do at work. But comfortable doesn't mean pajamas (at least not on top). ""Tailor your appearance to the person you are working or dealing with,"" recommended Jacqueline Whitmore, business etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach. But don't get too wrapped up in your appearance. ""I think people are more forgiving around these times of desperate measures,"" said Whitmore. ""The etiquette might not be as stringent.""  Get over your fear  Video calls work best when everyone gets on.  ""We are all in this socially awkward situation together,"" said Peter Arvai, co-founder and CEO of presentation software company Prezi.  And if some employees are in the office, everyone should still call in separately on their own device with a camera so you can see everyone clearly.  ""You want a good view of every participant,"" said Arvai. ""You don't want to see a few people with their mini heads, that doesn't work."" Don't sweat your background too much  If you have space in your home for a home office, that certainly makes it a lot easier to find a place to join a video call.  But for people living in smaller dwellings, the home office could be the kitchen table, sofa or the bedroom -- and that's ok.  Look for a background that is not distracting and put away any personal items that might be embarrassing or you want to keep private. And don't worry about any sports memorabilia, vacation photos or movie posters hanging on the wall. ""Use those things to establish the human connections,"" said Arvai. However, if you are meeting with a new or potential client, take the time to look more put together, Whitmore said. ""If you need to make a first impression, don't do it in your bedroom in your bed surrounded by your covers."" Find the light  Light is your friend when it comes to looking good and getting the most out of a video call.  ""What matters the most is to be able to see the facial expressions,"" said Arvai. ""If you can, sit by the window to have the light on your face, that creates a much better experience for others."" Make introductions Make sure meeting participants introduce themselves if everyone doesn't know one another, advised Aruna Ravichandran, vice president and chief marketing officer of Cisco's Webex Collaboration business. ""Remote work is all about personalization and getting people comfortable to be able to have a conversation,"" she said. Limit your distractions  You know how annoying it is when someone is constantly looking at their phone or typing on their laptop during in-person meetings? It's just as distracting in video meetings.  ""It can be disrespectful to other folks when you are constantly multitasking,"" said Ravichandran. Turn off any notifications and any other programs that might tempt you to do something else during the meeting.  ""You want to keep some level of decorum when working from home,"" said Whitmore. And remember: The mute button is your friend. If you aren't talking, be on mute. No one wants to hear you munching on your mid-morning snack. Just be sure to give people a few seconds to unmute themselves to respond to a question or chime in. The meeting facilitator should give a reminder at the top of the meeting for people to mute to help avoid interruptions throughout the meeting.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/religious-services-livestream/index.html,Finding God online: People turn to live-streaming religious services during coronavirus pandemic,"But because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Kamali family, who live on Manhattan's Upper East Side, ditched their typical costumes for pajamas as they watched the Megillah reading from their synagogue via live-stream on a laptop from their den. A bit of the festiveness was lost.  ""We were in and out of the room -- because how long could you sit there and stare at a screen?"" said Michele Kamali, a mom of three young children. Her kids would ""take out their graggers when you could faintly hear the word Haman."" And from what Kamali could tell, ""the synagogue was pretty empty."" Only a few people could be heard making noise in the synagogue during the same points of the reading. For Kamali, leaning on a virtual religious option wasn't an easy choice to make. ""I went back and forth deciding if I should take the kids to a Megillah reading,"" she said. In the end, she took a ""better safe than sorry"" approach. ""I'd rather be on a self-imposed isolation than a mandatory quarantine,"" she said, noting that she already knows two families who are in the latter camp right now. The number of religious institutions offering some version of live-streaming has grown in the last decade, yet there have long been some doubts that these options can truly recreate the experience of attending in the physical world. But just as the spread of coronavirus is forcing wide swaths of people to embrace remote work, telemedicine and online classes, it's also pushing some who never embraced virtual congregations to put their faith in the internet. The spread of the virus has already impacted people of all faiths and denominations around the world. Saudi Arabia took the precautionary step of closing two holy religious sites to foreigners for a time. In India and South Asia, some -- including India's prime minister -- stayed away from celebrating the Hindu festival Holi, where people sing, dance, and splash each other with colored powder and water. In the United States, a synagogue in New Rochelle is believed to be the epicenter of New York's outbreak after a member of the congregation tested positive, followed by the rabbi and his wife. This week, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear recommended that churches across the state cancel their services this weekend due to coronavirus concerns. ""I don't believe that whether you go to church during this period of time is a test of faith. I believe that God gives us wisdom to protect each other and we should do that,"" Beshear said. ""We have a lot of opportunity for virtual services."" Several places of worship told CNN Business they have seen digital demand soar in recent days. For St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, live-stream traffic has almost doubled in the last week, according to a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of New York. Churchome, a megachurch frequented by celebrities such as Justin Bieber, closed all of its Seattle locations until further notice, and has seen its app sign-ups rise 60% in a week. Churchome's virtual Sunday service attendance increased 23%, according to the church.  Saint Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, one of the hardest hit cities of the US, closed its doors this week for the first time since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. On Sunday, it plans to hold a service with a small crew of clergy and musicians conducted exclusively via live-stream for the first time in its history.  The cathedral has already seen its live-streams of services increase twofold. Last Sunday was one of the biggest days for online viewership since Saint Mark's began offering live-streaming in 2017, according to a spokesperson for the church. While it typically has 40 to 50 people watching live on a normal Sunday, last Sunday over 100 tuned in. The Very Reverend Steven L. Thomason, the dean of Saint Mark's and a former physician, said he has been holding virtual meetings with other church officials through Zoom conferencing in lieu of being in person when possible. Saint Mark's is also considering hosting a religious book club via video conference or conducting a live-streamed version of walking the Stations of the Cross, a series of images that symbolize a part of Jesus' passion and death. (The church already accepts offerings through Venmo.) ""If folks are isolated or quarantined, they quickly feel the challenges of that solitude and sense of loneliness,"" Reverend Thomason said. ""What technology affords us now is, even if those restrictions come about, we have the capacity to remain connected."" For observant Jews like Rebecca Taskin, who do not use technology on Shabbat, the live-streaming option has its limits. But Purim is an occasion where it is permissible to do so. So Taskin, who has a speech pathology practice in New York City, said she and a friend decided to stay in and participate in a Megillah reading service via live-stream.  ""I didn't feel the same sense of community at all. I felt pretty disconnected and it was more challenging to focus,"" she said. But because she works ""mostly with medically fragile children in their homes, I am trying to do my best to not expose myself to anybody that is exposed,"" she said. ""I'm not nervous for myself, I'm more nervous for the kids.""  Taskin said that while she typically tries to go to services every week, she probably will not go for the foreseeable future. Beyond live-streaming, congregants and places of worship are employing a mix of strategies to adapt to the coronavirus while maintaining their faith. For those who are attending in person, religious communities are taking new precautions to help prevent the spread of coronavirus within their congregations. These measures include no longer offering wine at communion, switching from challah loaves to rolls to avoid sharing and tearing bread, and replacing prayer books with Xeroxed hymn sheets. Muslims at the Islamic Center of Southern California have been asked not to embrace or kiss each other on the cheek, but instead to place a hand over their hearts, or give a respectful nod or smile.  For Kamali, her eldest child was ""distraught"" over the idea that Purim wouldn't be celebrated as usual. So the day after her lackluster livestream experience, Kamali hired a magician and a clown to put on a makeshift carnival -- complete with a cotton candy machine, Purim music, and limbo --  inside the common room in her apartment complex. Three other families who lived in the building joined, but no one was allowed to invite outside guests, per the building's new coronavirus policy, Kamali said. This time, the kids wore costumes.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,US unemployment claims skyrocketed last week. There's more pain to come,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. On Thursday, investors got a sense of just how much damage is being done.  Initial jobless claims soared to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ended March 21, according to the Department of Labor.  That is the highest number of initial jobless claims in history, since the agency started tracking the data in 1967. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in the week ending October 2, 1982. The jump marked a massive increase from a revised 282,000 claims in the prior week. Prior to the pandemic, initial claims had been hovering in the low 200,000s each week, reflecting a strong job market. The sudden spike is a major jolt to the labor market, which had been a point of strength for the US economy during its longest economic expansion on record. (Economists say that expansion has ended, and the US economy is in recession.) And it's not likely to be a one-off. Morgan Stanley predicts that jobless claims could ""remain at quite elevated levels for the time being,"" with layoffs continuing across the hospitality, retail and manufacturing sectors. This could send unemployment surging to an average 12.8% between April and June, according to the investment bank. That would be the highest unemployment rate on records that go back to the 1940s. Stimulus help: A $2 trillion stimulus package that's moving through Congress could help ease some of the immediate pain and set the country up for a stronger rebound once the crisis ends. But it may not be enough to keep investors from panicking when the readout on jobless claims comes through. US stocks shot up dramatically on Tuesday and rose again on Wednesday, the first back-to-back gains in more than a month. They're vulnerable, however, to more bad news. ""While the data [is] surely not going to come as a surprise, [it] may still shock and bring home the economic implications of what is happening,"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes told clients on Thursday. What's in the $2 trillion stimulus package The Senate has approved a historic $2 trillion stimulus package to prop up the US economy as it reels from the coronavirus pandemic, capping days of intense negotiations and putting the bill on a fast track to President Donald Trump. A huge step: The legislation is one of the most expensive and far-reaching measures Congress has ever considered, dwarfing the $800 billion stimulus bill Congress passed in 2009 during the Great Recession. Investors have cheered the measure, sending the S&P 500 10.5% higher in the past two days. So, what's in the bill? Highlights include: Direct payments to individuals. Single Americans would receive $1,200 and married couples would get $2,400. Payments would phase out above certain income thresholds.Boost to unemployment benefits. Jobless workers would get an extra $600 a week for four months on top of their state benefits. Lawmakers also want to extend benefits by up to 13 weeks. A new pandemic unemployment assistance program would help those who aren't traditionally covered, including gig economy workers.$500 billion lending program. The Treasury Department will be able to offer a huge amount of loans and loan guarantees, with some strings attached. This includes $25 billion for airlines, which will also receive $25 billion in grant money to cover wages and benefits for employees. Coming up: The US House of Representatives will convene at 9 a.m. ET on Friday to consider the relief package. It would then go to Trump, who has indicated he will sign the measure. Hotels hit hard by America's patchwork shutdown The United States — unlike countries like the United Kingdom, France and India — has not issued a blanket order for all citizens to stay indoors. But American hotels are still faltering as major cities shut down and travel slows to a trickle. The data: Nearly 70% of the hotel rooms in the United States were vacant last week, according to data and analytics group STR. That occupancy rate is a 56% decline compared to the same week last year.  San Francisco and New York were the worst hit. Less than 17% of hotel rooms in both cities were occupied, according to STR. That's a more than 80% decline for both versus this time last year. Shares in hotel companies did get a boost from the stock market rally over the past two days. But Marriott (MAR), the world's largest hotel chain, is still down nearly 44% this year, while Hilton's stock is off 35%. The S&P 500 has dropped just over 23% in 2020. Sign of strain: Marriott has put many of its employees on temporary leave for as many as three months. It's moved ahead with furloughs at its hotels and at the corporate level. Up next Later today: G20 leaders will meet by videoconference to discuss the coronavirus pandemic. The European Council will also meet by videoconference.The UK government is expected to unveil a plan to help self-employed workers.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/drivers-delivery-workers/index.html,The ride hailing industry is getting turned on its head by coronavirus,"Will Coleman, Alto's founder and CEO, said business was suddenly hurting, and badly, as ""people were starting to heed the warnings here in Dallas."" Ride volume had fallen by about 75% within a matter of days.  The one-and-half year old company didn't waste much time before reacting. Last week, it pivoted its focus to delivering food and goods to peoples' homes, while still servicing the occasional ride. The startup overhauled its website, notified drivers, and began striking up partnerships with local businesses to help service delivery needs ranging from garden supplies to groceries.  Alto's rideshare drivers aren't the only ones who have found themselves becoming accidental delivery workers. As the coronavirus pandemic has forced people to travel less and slashed requests for rides, it has also boosted demand for home deliveries of groceries, meals and other goods. The abrupt shift in consumer behavior caused by the pandemic is upending the on-demand industry, where the biggest companies were built first and foremost around ride-hailing services rather than food deliveries.  The City of New York said it would hire licensed TLC drivers to deliver food to New Yorkers in need. Meanwhile,Lyft, (LYFT) which has not historically offered delivery services, announced last week that it is piloting meal delivery services in the Bay Area in partnership with government agencies and local nonprofits to help those in need. It said it will work to expand the services throughout the country. But Thursday, Lyft sent an email to drivers suggesting they could find work at Amazon as one way of earning additional income, according to a copy of the email provided by Lyft. Last week, Amazon announced plans to hire 100,000 new distribution workers as people increasingly turn to the e-commerce giant to purchase household items during the pandemic. Uber (UBER), which is behind meal delivery service Uber Eats, said it has been encouraging drivers to toggle between its Driver and Delivery services via in-app notifications with instructions. The company said that in the US and Canada, the number of people signing up to deliver meals doubled last week from the week prior.  For Alto, the shift meant the startup had to essentially ""start from scratch again,"" said Coleman. But the silver lining was that many of the selling points of its rideshare business, which employs its drivers and is focused on safety and cleanliness, were transferable to delivery during this unprecedented health crisis.  Moving to food delivery may help some companies weather the crisis, but it could come at a cost. Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, notes that Uber's meal delivery business has been a ""money-losing"" venture that has weighed on the stock. Ives said the margins on delivery are lower than ride-hailing, as is how much the company takes on an order. ""Ride sharing remains the bread and butter for Uber and Lyft with some dark days ahead as lockdowns remain around the world,"" he said. In a blog post this week, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, head of Uber's food delivery platform Eats, wrote that ""while it's too early to say what impact the coronavirus crisis will have on food delivery overall, we're seeing signals that people are relying on delivery services more.""  ""Cities like Seattle and San Francisco have seen an uptick in food delivery requests on Uber Eats recently,"" he added. (Both locations are under stay-at-home orders.) For some companies, the trend has led to rapid expansion. Instacart, the grocery delivery startup, said this week that it plans to bring on 300,000 additional workers in North America over the next three months to help meet its surging demand.  Erica Mighetto, a rideshare driver for Uber and Lyft, is one of the many now considering picking up orders for Instacart. She said demand for rides has plummeted so much that continuing to drive for the platforms has not even been worth the price of gas for her car recently. She also has a heart condition and wants to stay home to protect her health, but she has a car loan payment due. ""My plan for the next few days is to try Uber Eats,"" she said, adding that she applied to work for Instacart last week but has yet to start taking orders. She's still nervous about ""setting foot in a grocery store where there's more people."" ",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/media/media-layoffs/index.html,"Hundreds of journalists are being laid off, right when the public needs them the most","But no one could have predicted that a global health crisis would hit just as business was picking up.  BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti told staffers in a memo this week that the company had been knocked off track because of coronavirus. ""Though we were well on track to be profitable this year, the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy will almost certainly cause the company to lose money, even as we take aggressive action to control costs,"" Peretti wrote.  BuzzFeed has instituted paycuts and scaled back on travel and hiring. According to the memo, which was obtained by CNN Business, Peretti will not take a salary for the rest of the year.  ""Personally, I'd rather lose money than lose colleagues,"" Jane Lytvynenko, senior reporter at BuzzFeed News, tweeted.  A record-shattering 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week after residents in many parts of the country were ordered to stay home and practice social distancing. Events were canceled, bars were shuttered, restaurants pivoted to takeout-only, and ad dollars dried up. Many industries are reeling from the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic, and the already fragile media industry is now under serious threat. CNN Business reported on Sunday that at least 100 people in local newsrooms in the US lost their jobs in March. By Friday, that number shot up to at least 300 people as the impact of coronavirus continues to roil newspapers and digital media companies. Traffic boom BuzzFeed avoided layoffs through salary reductions, but that strategy isn't being implemented everywhere. Future PLC, which owns Laptop Mag, Tom's Guide, Live Science and other publications, is planning to lay off at least nine employees out of 59 in the union, according to a statement from its union on Tuesday.  Marshall Honorof, an editor at Tom's Guide who has worked there for seven years, was told last Friday over video chat with a member of the union's bargaining committee that he was one of the nine ""proposed"" layoffs. The company is still in contract negotiations with the union. The two sides were supposed to meet on March 18, but that was postponed.  ""I am being paid. I have health insurance. I have access to my emails, but I do not have a firm idea of when I will have to leave, or at this point, even if I will have to leave,"" Honorof told CNN Business. ""I certainly hope not."" Rafi Letzter, a writer at Live Science and member of Future's union, told CNN Business that the union is hoping management will find another solution to cut costs -— one that will not require laying off people who he says are crucial to the company's news coverage.  ""There is concern across the board, both in the unit and outside of it, that management does not understand the consequences of some of the layoffs they've proposed,"" Letzter said. ""In many instances, they're maintaining the accuracy and quality of coronavirus coverage. Everyone is working very hard, frankly, harder than the company has earned from them at this point.""  The sad twist about these layoffs and restructuring is that they come just as the public is hungry for information about the pandemic, but there are now fewer journalists to provide vital information about it. Traffic is up for many sites and TV ratings have increased as people are stuck at home watching the news.  Letzter has written a number of coronavirus news stories and explainers, including one titled ""Can homemade masks protect you from COVID-19?"" Letzter told CNN Business that Live Science's site traffic has been the ""highest in its history.""  Future executives did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When CNN Business described the urgency to the company's phone operator, she said she was among those being laid off.  Vox Media, which reported a profit last year, has not announced layoffs or pay cuts. Last week, Chairman and CEO Jim Bankoff told staff that adjustments would need to be made, according to a company memo obtained by CNN Business.   ""While there will obviously be impact, at this point it is too early to understand those implications,"" Bankoff wrote. ""There are already some immediate cost savings that we will see from the suspension of business travel, offsites, work at conferences, and other items."" A Vox Media spokesperson declined to make Bankoff available for further comment.  The head of G/O Media, the company formerly known as Gizmodo Media Group, which owns Deadspin, Jezebel and Jalopnik, sent a dire email to his staff last week with the subject line ""Brace For Impact."" ""This will not be an easy nor fun period for our company let alone just about any other company with our dynamics,"" CEO Jim Spanfeller wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNN Business. ""I am sure you have all been following the news around the overall economic picture and how disturbing it is, as well as the stock market dive that has been nothing short of terrifying. This will hurt."" A G/O spokesperson told CNN Business, ""There's been a meaningful uptick in traffic, no layoffs planned and too early to have a clear picture on revenue."" CNN Business also reached out to Vice and Group Nine about their plans but have not heard back.  Freelancers left in the lurch As newsrooms seek to cut costs, some have eliminated their freelance budgets. California freelancers were already struggling after a state law went into effect in January that restricted their output to 35 submissions a year per outlet. The law, AB 5, prompted Vox Media to part ways with hundreds of its California-based freelancers.  The stress has only increased in the wake of coronavirus as freelancers are limited not only by newsroom budgets but also by their lack of company-sponsored health insurance. On March 17, Vice published a story by Clio Chang about the perils she could have faced as a freelancer had Vice not recently hired her as a full-time writer.  ""Today, I have steady income that will allow me to weather this epidemic for now, without worrying where my next assignment is coming from,"" Chang wrote. ""While I was lucky enough to have money saved up from previous jobs, the slowdown in work under coronavirus could have been disastrous if I were living paycheck-to-paycheck as many freelancers do.""  Monica Castillo, a freelance film critic and writer, told CNN Business that on March 18 she started receiving emails from small and mid-size outlets she frequently contributed to about budget freezes.  ""It's weird that so many things are changing in the movie industry, and there's nowhere for me to cover it,"" Castillo said. ""I'm down to my last three assignments and then once those are done, there's nothing. I haven't been this out of work since, I can't remember when, since maybe the start of my career.""  Local papers furloughing  Local newsrooms continue to face constraints on their business and this especially troubling during a global pandemic with local ramifications. New Orleans is one of the fastest growing hot spots of coronavirus cases in the US. With the sharp increase in cases and hospitals running out of capacity, the community needs access to quality information more than ever. On Monday, Editor Peter Kovacs and Publisher Judi Terzotis of the The Advocate in Baton Rouge publicly announced they would be ""temporarily furloughing about a tenth of our 400-member workforce, and the rest of us will begin four-day workweeks."" The Advocate had absorbed The New Orleans' Times-Picayune last year after the latter lost more than 150 staffers in a round of layoffs. Kovacs and Terzotis said on Monday, ""Our newsroom, with about 120 employees, is the largest in Louisiana, and the furloughs will chiefly impact people who cover sports and social events, which have been curtailed."" In an interview with CNN Business, Kovacs emphasized the ""temporarily"" of that statement. Kovacs added that less than half of his newsroom's sports department had been furloughed. ""We think we'll do well once this is over. We just don't know what over means,"" Kovacs said. ""I think this is a case of us wanting to be cautious early about not really understanding the duration of this mostly."" Some of the remaining sports reporters have switched beats to cover other topics such as the local government. ""[Hurricane] Katrina had this quality too. We had a much bigger staff in those days, but you had some parts of the newspaper where there was no content being created and other parts where there was too much content,"" Kovacs said. What the future holds Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at Poynter, told CNN Business that he is seeing more newsrooms furlough employees rather than lay them off.  ""Furloughs are where you anticipate there's a pretty good chance you want to bring them back. You don't want to lose good employees,"" Edmonds said. ""Do what needs to be done to respond to a sharp drop but not to cripple the strategy.""  Governments in other countries are getting involved to help keep their media industries afloat. The BBC, which is supported by government-mandated fees paid for by UK citizens, is suspending a plan to cut 450 jobs. The cuts would have saved £40 million, but the BBC's director general said it ""would be inappropriate"" given the need to cover the crisis. The Canadian government announced on Thursday its plan to spend $30 million on an ad campaign for coronavirus awareness.  ""Right now, it is more important than ever that Canadians have access to the latest news and information,"" said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""To ensure that journalists can continue to do this vital work, our government is announcing new measures to support them."" Could federal or state support come to the aid of US newspapers? Not likely, said Joel Kaplan, an associate dean for professional graduate studies and professor of magazine, newspaper and digital journalism at Syracuse University.  ""I definitely don't see the federal government being involved,"" Kaplan said. ""They are involved to the extent that they contribute to PBS and NPR."" Both NPR and PBS are public broadcasters funded by the US government.  But Kaplan said US media could get a subscription boost from individuals looking for reliable coronavirus news and businesses running more ads when they reopen. ""We're in an unbelievable crisis that no one's ever seen in anyone, who's alive, lifetime, and guess what their lifeline is? It's the local news media because it's the only way they're keeping informed,"" Kaplan said. ",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/apple-coronavirus-website/index.html,Apple releases coronavirus screening app and website in partnership with CDC,"Both tools were developed in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the White House's Coronavirus Task Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Apple said in a statement to CNN Business. The app and website include a questionnaire and information about the novel coronavirus. Apple said it will not collect or store users' answers to the questionnaire, though it will collect anonymous information about usage of the tools. The screening tools do not require an Apple account to use, the company said. Friday's announcement follows statements by CEO Tim Cook that Apple will be donating 10 million face masks across Europe and the United States. ""Our ops teams are helping to find and purchase masks from our supply chain in coordination with governments around the world,"" Cook tweeted this week. It also comes on the heels of a nationwide website launched by Google last week to provide users with information about the coronavirus. The website was expected to add links to a CDC screening tool when it became available; a Google spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/text-alert-coronavirus/index.html,How governments are using text alerts to fight the coronavirus pandemic,"They detail the exact locations and movements of people who have tested positive with novel coronavirus. Or they issue regular reminders and instructions on how to prevent the disease from spreading.  One district sent out a message on February 25 detailing a person's movements four days previously, down to the specific hours they were at an elementary school, town center and grocery store.  Another from the Central Disaster Relief Headquarters on March 26 gave what has become for South Koreans a near daily instruction on social distancing, hand washing, coughing etiquette, and how to care for seniors. South Korea has apparently managed — for the time being — to ""flatten the curve"" and limit the spread of the virus. Experts attribute the recent decline in new cases in the country to its early testing efforts, contact tracing and surveillance. South Korea's emergency alert system uses cell broadcasting, meaning that through technology installed within the mobile network, the government can blast out messages, reaching most people with a cell phone.  But the United Kingdom and other European countries lag behind places like South Korea on emergency text messages, a service experts in security and emergency preparedness believe could be vital in helping inform populations and control the virus. So how do governments get messages directly to millions of people? Do they have everyone's number?  There are three main ways to get mass mobile messages to people, and in all of them, governments don't need direct access to every single number.  The first is through cell phone companies, which is how UK residents received an alert earlier this week about new stay at home rules. The government had to ask each mobile network operator to send out the alerts on their behalf, and as a result some people received the message hours after others. There are another two ways governments can blast out messages to all users without asking the network operators for permission, said Javier Colado, senior vice president of Everbridge (EVBG), a software company that provides governments and organizations tools to manage critical events. Both require specific technology and hardware to be embedded within mobile networks, and operators can be compelled by governments to allow that.  The first option is the cell broadcast service used by South Korea and the United States where the government uses the network operators' cellular towers and radio cells to push out a message in a matter of seconds, without officials needing access to any specific information on SIM cards or phone numbers. Though this system typically reaches more than 80% of the population (including people who have mobile data switched off), those with older phones or the cell broadcast feature somehow disabled may not receive the message. The second option, called SMS location-based messaging, can target people based on a specific location, get more information on them and interact with them. Governments can choose a specific area on a map and send a message to all cell phones active in that area. Though the messages don't go out as quickly as the cell broadcast service, Colado said, the upside is governments can ask people if they need help, or if they have symptoms of the disease.  Michael Hallowes, who previously lead the implementation of the emergency alert system in Australia as emergency commissioner for Victoria, told CNN Business that a SMS location-based service can be so finely tailored it could send messages to everyone crowding in a park, or just a single apartment block. If people need to disperse or be evacuated, the system could message all cell phones in the area, and be able to check on a heat map whether they complied.  The system in Australia, Hallowes said, has a 97% successful delivery rate, which Hallowes said is far above mass cell broadcasting or asking the operators to text their subscriber base.  These types of text messages work, said Dr. Fred Muench, president of the US-based Center on Addiction who has conducted extensive research on using digital messaging for public health.  ""Overall, SMS campaigns for public health are the most effective medium for mass dissemination due to their reach, immediacy, opportunity for data collection and personalization, ability to tailor and adapt information, and opportunity to link to other sources,"" Muench told CNN Business. ""We found that personalizing and adaptively tailoring text messages has the largest effects compared to other types of messages."" EU and UK lagging behind Hallowes, now managing director of Zefonar which advises governments on emergency alert systems, said personal information used for this purpose is anonymized and data protection laws such as GDPR contain specific caveats for processing of certain data for emergencies and public health issues like pandemics.  ""The ability to remotely monitor and manage the human impacts of this coronavirus through data our mobile phones naturally generate and operator networks process lawfully everyday has got to be of great utility to protecting our key workers from having to encounter people in breach, as well was giving us the analysis in real time of how widespread the infection is,"" Hallowes said.  An EU directive passed in 2018 says that by June 2022, all member countries should have a mobile alert system in place that can warn citizens and visitors in a specific area about any local emergency. In 2014, the United Kingdom tried out an emergency alert system, but it was never put into place despite a government report recommending it, hence the need this week to ask the mobile network operators to send out a message on their behalf. Toby Harris, a Labour Party member of the House of Lords who has long advocated for emergency alert systems and resiliency planning, slammed the UK government for dragging its feet on a system he believes could ""undoubtedly"" save lives. ""This shilly shallying has been going on for the last six years. Now is the time to take action,"" Lord Harris told CNN Business. ""What seems to have happened, they did some testing, and no one could agree which department should lead on it and which would pay for it and in the end nothing happened."" Colado said as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, several countries are just now ramping up efforts, reaching out to his company in recent weeks for help.  ""It's a pity because the reality today we face is a lot of countries coming to us asking what we can do quickly and these things don't get set up in 24 hours so we need more time,"" he said.  — Jake Kwan contributed to this report from South Korea.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/media/trump-fox-news-media-attacks/index.html,Trump in crisis mode uses Hannity interview to attack the media and Democratic governors,"The targets include Democratic governors, presidential candidate Joe Biden and even a key member of Trump's coronavirus task force, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. On Friday, Trump's re-election campaign promoted anti-Biden messages on social media, including an image that said, in all-caps, ""Biden left the federal stockpile of N95 masks depleted"" and ""failed our country.""  Biden left the vice presidency more than three years ago. Bashing Biden, the expected Democratic nominee for president, is a no-brainer for Trump allies. But one of the other recent targets is much more surprising. While some in conservative media have praised Fauci, including Sean Hannity and his prime time Fox News colleague Laura Ingraham, other influential pro-Trump voices on social media have come after him for, in their view, urging excessive measures to slow the spread of the virus. Moments when Fauci has contradicted Trump's misinformation have also drawn ire. One far-right commentator has given Fauci the derisive nickname ""Dr. Doom."" Jerome Corsi, an author, conspiracy theorist and associate of Roger Stone, implied that Fauci was trying to stoke fear by comparing him to an Elizabethan character who dabbled in black magic. ""How Dr. Faustus hates giving up his little bit of power & his moment of glory SCARING USA that COVID-19 may become seasonal, returning stronger next year,"" he said in a tweet. In what appears to be an attempt to smear Fauci, right-wing opinion site The Gateway Pundit published an article on Friday that called out what it said was his ""friendship"" with the director-general of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The Washington Post pointed out that on Fox News' business network, host Lou Dobbs said on Monday that ""frankly Fauci was wrong"" about the use of experimental medicine.  Politico said the Fauci critics are on the ""right-wing fringe,"" and noted that both Trump and Fauci have dismissed talk about Trump being unhappy with the doctor. The Post noted that while both men are trying to ""tamp down the appearance of tension,"" the President is growing wary of medical consensus.  That Hannity interview Some of the right-wing commentary has an ""I'm rubber, you're glue"" feel — as hosts like  Hannity scrutinized the federal government's failures and bounced it back to Trump's critics. On Thursday night, before Trump called in to Hannity's show and said the federal government is merely a backup system for the states, Hannity tore into New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. An on-screen graphic of their faces was titled ""FAILURE TO PREPARE."" ""Both of you need to stop politicizing this national emergency,"" Hannity told them through the TV. Cuomo and de Blasio have challenged Trump to provide more military resources, nationalize the medical supply chain and take other steps to help states. Trump has bristled at the criticism — and so have his supporters with big media megaphones.  Hannity said New York City and the state should have been better prepared for the pandemic: ""You need to own up to your mistakes,"" he said Thursday night. Trump's re-election campaign has been pushing the same set of talking points, seemingly shifting blame from the president to local officials. ""The people of New York City are suffering because of Bill de Blasio's incompetence,"" the @TrumpWarRoom Twitter account asserted on Thursday, followed by a hashtag that misspelled the word coronavirus. During his 40-minute-long chat with Hannity, Trump said he is ""getting along"" with Cuomo, though he cast doubt on New York state's scientific projections of the spread of the virus. Regarding ventilators, he said officials like Cuomo ""say we want 30,000 of them. 30,000! Think of this. You go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital, and now all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers."" Cuomo's pleas are based on best-in-class modeling and medical expertise. But Trump still expressed skepticism about the scale of the crisis. He told Hannity, ""I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators."" Trump also used the televised phone call to criticize two Democratic governors, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Jay Inslee of Washington state. ""We've had a big problem"" with Whitmer, he said, without identifying her by name.  Trump also noted Inslee's political standing, calling him a ""failed presidential candidate"" who is ""always complaining.""  ""We don't like to see the complaints,"" he added. Trump's remarks generated a new round of criticism on Friday morning. On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Willie Geist said governors are having to factor in Trump's emotions: ""If you dare raise hell, because literally the life of your citizens depends on it, he calls in to Sean Hannity's show and rips you as a failed presidential candidate. That's the balance these governors are looking at."" Countless political commentators have observed that Trump always needs an enemy. As the pandemic has overtaken national politics, his chosen enemies have included China, news media outlets and Biden.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/automakers-ventilator-production-coronavirus/index.html,Automakers are racing to make ventilators. But it's not that easy,"So far Ford, GM, Toyota and Tesla, which have all temporarily shut down their factories in recent weeks, have pledged to help. On Friday, President Donald Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act to require GM to ""accept, perform, and prioritize"" federal contracts for ventilators.  That should help expedite things. But switching from cars to ventilators is not so easy. Ventilators are complex machines that use sophisticated software and specialized parts, and companies that seek to manufacture them face several hurdles — including intellectual property rights, the need for specially trained workers, regulatory approvals and safety considerations.  So far, automakers have announced they've been teaming up with existing ventilator makers to help them ramp up production. And some, like Ford (F),  and GM (GM), are exploring producing ventilators in their own factories. But it's a race against time.  Already, sick patients are overwhelming hospitals in New York. The state fears it is headed for a situation like the one that played out in Italy, where ventilator shortages forced doctors to choose which patients get to use the potentially lifesaving machines. ""The number of ventilators we need is so astronomical,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday, adding that hospitals have resorted to using experimental solutions, such as putting two patients on one machine. There are about 160,000 ventilators available in America but as many as 740,000 could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Ventilators can help some of the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients who start losing the ability to breathe on their own. The devices offer gentle breathing assistance so a person's lungs can rest while they fight the virus. The best way automakers can help fast Not all ventilators are exactly alike. Some are more complex than others. The sickest COVID-19 patients' lungs can stiffen, requiring high-end machines that cost up to $50,000. Those machines can be precisely tailored for patients and must be operated by trained medical professionals.  Production and assembly of these high-end devices are best left to traditional ventilator manufacturers, according to Vafa Jamali, a vice president at Medtronic, which is one of only a handful of companies that manufacture ventilators.  Key components are made in-house by experienced workers. Medtronic said. Not only does it not want to outsource that production, but auto makers aren't capable of making these high-end machines — at least not quickly. ""Because this is a lifesaving device, it can't be off. Practice and experience making the parts is really, really critical,"" Jamali said.  On its own, Medtronic said it has already boosted its weekly ventilator production by 40% since January, in part by putting its assembly lines on a 24-hour schedule. And the company plans to ramp up production by another 200% over the next several weeks by doubling the workers on existing production lines.  Its goal is to ramp up output of top-of-the-line ventilators to 500 per week, a five-fold increase. Still, the company will only be able to manufacture ventilators by the hundreds — and doctors need them by the thousands. That's why the company says it is welcoming ideas from automakers to help fill the gap. Medtronic has spoken with Tesla, GM and Ford, though the companies don't have any formal plans to work together yet, Medtronic told CNN Business. General Motors (GM) said last Friday that it was working with another ventilator maker, Ventec Life Systems, to help increase Ventec's production. The companies are ramping up to produce as many as 10,000 units a month or more, they said in a later announcement. Some of the ventilators will be built in GM's Kokomo, Indiana, electronics assembly plant. The first of these ventilators are expected to be delivered in April, the companies said. The New York Times reported late Thursday that the White House was about to announce the venture between GM and Ventec, which the report said would allow for the production of as many as 80,000 ventilators. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it needed more time to assess whether the venture was too costly. GM responded to the report in a statement, saying ""efforts to set up manufacturing capacity at the GM Kokomo facility are already underway to produce Ventec's critical care ventilator."" It also said it had begun hiring workers for the venture. For its part, Ford has announced it is working with GE Healthcare to increase production of GE's ventilators. Jim Baumbick is the vice president in charge of all of Ford's vehicle product lines, but lately he's turned his attention to gearing up healthcare technology production. He said Ford, which introduced mass production to the auto industry, has identified efficiencies that can be made to GE's production processes that will increase output in coming weeks. Ford has also been able to find additional suppliers for some parts that make up the ventilators, Baumbick said, so that GE doesn't face bottlenecks in its supply chain. The automaker has even suggested changes to parts so they could be more easily produced by other suppliers.  GE Healthcare declined to provide additional details about its work with Ford, but did say it is planning to double its output by the end of June. Toyota is also ""finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity,"" the company said Friday in an emailed statement. Toyota did not say which medical device companies are involved. A less complex machine  Medtronic makes less complex ventilator machines for the less critically ill as well, and the firm is considering making ""one or two"" of its designs open source. That would allow outside manufacturers to take over production of fully functioning machines.  Jamali said he is confident automakers could get the job done.  But, he added, ""the question is: What is the time frame of when you start and when you're meaningfully putting ventilators on the market?"" Jamali said. As part of its partnership with GE Healthcare, Ford is helping to design a new, simple ventilator that would be relatively easy to produce, Baumbick said. To do this, Ford and GE designers are starting with a machine used for anesthesia. It's a machine that, at its core, is a sort of ventilator. The idea, Baumbick said, is to strip away anything that isn't needed for breathing. ""It's kind of getting down to first principles,"" Baumbick said.  Once that machine has been successfully designed, he said, it could be manufactured at a facility outside of GE. It could even be made at a Ford factory, he added. But the companies did not give a timeline for when that production could begin.  The Food and Drug Administration says it has implemented drastic regulatory changes to allow automakers and other non-medical manufacturers to quickly take up such tasks. ""FDA's message is clear,"" the agency said in a March 22 statement. ""If you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way."" For example, the agency said it is not enforcing rules that require ventilator manufacturers to gain FDA approval before making slight changes to their devices.  That approach ""will help manufacturers that want to add production lines or manufacture at alternative sites [that] may have different manufacturing equipment,"" according to the FDA guidance. Intellectual property concerns loom But some traditional manufacturers remain cautious about working with third parties.  If there is a flaw in production, ""it would be a catastrophe if you got those devices out en masse,"" said Jamali. ""You could cause a lot of damage in the patients that are most acute."" Intellectual property rights may also present obstacles. Designs for ventilators, their software or key components are often patented or involve trade secrets.  The medical device industry has ""historically been extremely sensitive about protecting its intellectual property,"" said Debbie Wang, a Morningstar analyst who covers Medtronic. ""And I can't imagine that would necessarily go away,"" she added — even in the face of a pandemic. Patrick Keane, an IP attorney that works with hospitals and ventilator manufacturers, agreed that intellectual property concerns could make traditional manufacturers hesitant to work with third-party manufacturers. The Defense Production Act is the most powerful tool the government has to ensure that doesn't happen. Invoking it allows the White House to direct production.  It will be up to the companies who are given ventilator manufacturer directives to ensure they aren't liable for patent infringement after the crisis passes, according to Keane. The president was under growing pressure to use his DPA powers in order to better coordinate the production and distribution of badly needed ventilators. Doing so, proponents argued, would alleviate the concerns of state governors, such as New York's Cuomo, who are desperate for new ventilators. But the issue will continue to come back to a major supply gap and a race against the clock. Current ventilator production levels fall far short of demand — and setting up new production lines is no simple task. ""You don't want people who are producing air conditioning units for cars to all of a sudden start producing entire ventilators,"" he said.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/business/3m-ceo-n95-masks-target/index.html,3M CEO: Our medical masks should not be showing up in stores ,"3M is the largest maker of medical face masks, specifically the N95 respirator mask. Roman also said 3M is working with federal and state authorities to curb counterfeiting and price gouging of its products and devices, including the masks.  ""We are in the process of working with large e-marketplace operators on a coordinated strategy and action plan to identify and remove counterfeiters and price gougers and to refer them to the appropriate law enforcement authorities,"" Roman wrote in a letter Tuesday to Attorney General William Barr. Hospitals nationwide are facing an acute shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) such as N95 masks, gloves and surgical gowns amid the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, more than 38,000 Americans have been infected across all 50 states, and at least 414 people have died. In light of this desperate need, Roman said 3M's N95 masks should not be showing up in stores, he told CNBC. Roman said he was ""disappointed"" that the masks were selling in some stores over the weekend, alluding to Target.  Target (TGT) said a select number of stores in the Seattle area were selling the N95 masks ""in error.""  ""We apologize for our error. We worked quickly to remove these masks from our stores and donated them to the Washington State Department of Health for distribution to local hospitals,"" a Target spokesperson told CNN Business. The retailer said it has thoroughly reviewed its full inventory for any additional masks and will donate them the medical community.  Calls out counterfeiting and price gouging Roman said 3M will not increase prices for respirators despite the surging demand.  In the letter to Barr, he said individuals and organizations that are engaging in profiteering from its products amid the coronavirus pandemic are engaging in ""unethical actions"" and that 3M would work with authorities to hold them accountable. Pressure is mounting on medical equipment makers to quickly boost production to meet the rapidly rising new cases of coronavirus infections. Roman said 3M has ramped up production of N95 respirators and doubled its global output to nearly 100 million per month.  ""In the United States we are producing 35 million respirators per month. Of these, more than 90% are now designated for healthcare workers, with the remaining deployed to other industries also critical in this pandemic, including energy, food and pharmaceutical companies,"" Roman said in a Linkedin post on Sunday.  He said more than 500,000 respirators are being sent this week to some of the more critically impacted areas, such as New York and Seattle. About half of the total coronavirus cases in the United States are in New York State. ""I want people to know we are doing all we can to meet the demands of this extraordinary time and get supplies from our plants to where they're most needed as quickly as possible,"" he said.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/venmo-cash-app-stimulus/index.html,Venmo and Cash App want to deliver government stimulus payments ,"They're hoping to change that with the government's new stimulus package, and are going on a public campaign to be considered as a way for the Treasury Department to deliver payments directly to Americans. Amid that effort, the parent companies of the two apps have had talks with Treasury about that possibility, two sources from the electronic payment industry told CNN Business, though it's not clear how seriously Treasury is taking the idea. The Treasury Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Advocates for the electronic payment services argue they offer a quicker way of getting stimulus dollars to Americans than sending checks by mail.  Many of the people who directly receive money from the $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law on Friday will get their payments through direct deposit; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has indicated the first payments will go to people whose bank information is already on file with the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes. But not everyone can get their money via direct deposit. Fourteen percent of Americans whose income is under $40,000 do not have a bank account, according to figures published last year by the Federal Reserve.  Apps like Venmo and Cash App can be used by Americans even if they do not have bank accounts. Jack Dorsey, the founder and CEO of Square, which owns Cash App, publicly appealed to the US government on Thursday, tweeting, ""People need help immediately. The technology exists to get money to most people today (even to those without bank accounts). Square and many of our peers can get it done. US government: let us help."" Dorsey is also the co-founder and current CEO of Twitter. Even if the Treasury Department did decide it wanted to use payment apps, though, it would still face a major hurdle to doing so — one major goal of the government's stimulus efforts is to get payments to Americans as quickly as possible, something that might be at odds with any attempt to introduce a new payment mechanism.  ""I think this presents an interesting way to think about reaching people who may not have traditional bank accounts,"" Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation, told CNN Business on Friday. ""However, while I don't know everything necessary to make such a partnership happen, it may not be feasible for the government to enter into those agreements, match data, and all the other steps that would be necessary to harness an app for the recovery rebates any quicker than it would take to process and send them directly."" ""I think one of the timing challenges at play here is figuring out who gets a rebate and what size they get —  that's not really an issue that an app-based service would have the data on,"" she added. The government also faces the challenge of getting money to people who did not earn enough money to file tax returns.  Currently the IRS says there is no sign-up needed to get stimulus money.  It's going to rely on 2019 and 2018 tax returns, and then use Social Security benefit statements as a backstop, and will use whatever bank account or address is on file.  Staff from Square and PayPal, which owns Venmo, have had private talks with Treasury over the past few weeks, two sources from the electronic payment industry who are familiar with the discussions, tell CNN Business.  ""They [the US government] know they need to get this money out the door quickly so I think they are open to quicker methods,"" one of the sources told CNN Business on Friday. ""Last time they were doing this was 2008 and 2009 and the technology didn't exist as it does today,"" they added, referring to government payouts after the 2008 recession.  The source said the talks were still in their exploratory stages. ""We are at the point now of looking into the technical challenges and what data the government could share with a third party. I think Treasury is very open to it,"" they added. Jodie Kelley, the CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association, a trade body that represents companies including Square and PayPal, told CNN Business Friday that ""the payments industry stands ready to help distribute these stimulus dollars."" ""Everyone agrees that it is most important to get money in people's hands as soon as possible,"" Kelley said, adding that prepaid cards could also be used.  In a letter to President Trump and Mnuchin last week, Kelley wrote, ""many Americans do not have a bank account at a traditional financial institution. Upon receipt of a stimulus check, they would need to rely on expensive cash checking services to access their money. By utilizing electronic payments products those consumers wouldn't need to depend on the high fee structure of a cash checking business."" Both Venmo and Cash App offer debit cards to users, meaning that users with one of those cards could use money transferred to their accounts to pay for products and services. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Cash App pointed CNN Business to Dorsey's tweet.   PayPal declined to comment. A spokesperson for Zelle, a payment service owned by several American banks, said it had ""offered to the U.S. Treasury Department the use of Zelle and other account solutions as services for the Federal Government to get stimulus funds quickly and safely to the American public."" — CNN's Katie Lobosco and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",3/28/2020

Another $340 million in Google ad credits will be available to small and medium-sized businesses whose accounts have been active over the past year, Pichai said, with an additional $20 million earmarked for announcements on relief funds and support for small businesses.  Google is one of several tech companies putting some of their vast financial and technical resources toward trying to combat the global pandemic. Apple (AAPL) on Friday released a website and an iOS app that allows users to screen themselves for coronavirus symptoms, days after announcing that it would donate more than 10 million respirator masks across the US and Europe.  Facebook (FB), like Google, has offered free ad credits to the WHO and other institutions to provide accurate information about the coronavirus, but the WHO has not officially placed any ads on Facebook yet. The organization is working with Facebook in other capacities, including the company's Coronavirus Information Center and a health alert account on WhatsApp launched last week.  Tech firms from other countries are also pitching in to combat the virus in the US, where the number of confirmed cases is now the highest in the world. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (SFTBF) and Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) have pledged to donate around a million masks each to US health workers.  Beyond its advertising initiatives, Google is setting up a $200 million investment fund to help small businesses get access to capital as well as offering $20 million in Google Cloud credits for academics and researchers working on combating the coronavirus.  Google is also working with one of its suppliers, Magid Glove & Safety, to produce up to 3 million masks in the coming weeks that it will donate to the CDC. ",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/animal-crossing-wedding-half-life-alyx-school/index.html,People are holding video game weddings and graduation ceremonies,"From weddings and graduation ceremonies to classes, people are taking the extra time they have indoors to meet up online. More than half of America is officially urged to stay home during the growing pandemic.  New Jersey residents Sharmin Asha and Nazmul Ahmed told CNN Business that they had planned to hold their wedding in downtown Brooklyn on April 12, but the uptick of Covid-19 cases made them change their plans. ""I work in a hospital and I've been around patients that have potentially Covid, and a lot of healthcare workers, so I didn't want to expose anyone to that,"" said Asha, 28, who is planning to graduate this May and become a doctor. Instead, Ahmed surprised Asha with a symbolic wedding celebration on Sunday in Nintendo's new game ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons,"" while postponing the real-life wedding date to next year. They plan to get legally married within a couple of months once it's safe to go outside and travel again.  ""Animal Crossing"" is a slow-paced game set on an idyllic island, where you can build furniture and meet friends. Many people, including Asha and Ahmed, who don't usually play video games, are getting into ""Animal Crossing"" to socialize during this isolating time. Ahmed, 28, an engineer, said, ""I wanted to show her that even though we can't physically celebrate with our friends and family, we still have a ton of love and support coming our way."" Their virtual beach wedding featured their initials on the sand, flowers and six of their friends in the game. Five other real-life friends who didn't own the game followed along in a video call. Ahmed even created clothes that resembled a shirt and tie that he owns in real life. ""It was very sweet,"" said Asha. Video game sales have risen for retailers and online stores, as analysts anticipate more people playing as they stay home. PC game store Steam reported an all-time high of over 22 million users on Sunday. ""People are still figuring out things like, 'how do I watch Netflix with friends through Zoom?'"" said Carter Rogers, principal analyst at SuperData, a Nielsen company that tracks the video game industry. ""But video games are already here and have been doing social play for years, so it's pretty natural for people to gravitate toward games.""  As events get canceled, including student graduations, some are turning to games to honor major life milestones. Alvaro Romero, 24, a brand strategist in Queens, New York, said he helped his best friend celebrate his graduation from the New York City Fire Department's Emergency Medical Services Academy in the shooter game ""Apex Legends."" The ceremony was scheduled for June but was postponed due to Covid-19. Because the game only allows squads of three, Romero, his best friend, and a third gamer held a celebration, playing as characters like Bangalore that possesses smoke skills and Crypto who has a drone that can light up a firework-like display for the celebration. The FDNY declined to make the EMS student available for an interview. As a fast-paced shooter game where squads face off to be the last ones standing, ""Apex Legends"" proved to be a tough setting for a ceremony. Romero and his friends lost the first few games before they could get to launch their celebration.  After those attempts, they managed to give a short speech and play a graduation song through Romero's Google Home.  ""The whole gaming community has joked about being built for moments like this,"" said Romero, referring to the amount of people staying home.   Teachers across the United States are adapting to conducting lessons via the internet. Charles Coomber, 30, a San Diego middle school teacher, bought a new video game ""Half-Life: Alyx"" and was playing it during his break when he realized he could use the game to teach geometry. ""Half-Life: Alyx"" is a shooter game about fighting an occupying alien force. The virtual reality game starts off in Alyx's apartment which conveniently has a dry erase board, markers and an eraser. ""I looked around and I was like, 'oh my gosh, I can make a hilarious video here and my kids are gonna love this,'"" Coomber told CNN Business.  His video went viral on YouTube and Reddit, and his students seemed to absorb the material, he said. ""We actually did a quiz on it,"" he said on Wednesday.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/thomas-keller-lawsuit-coronavirus-losses/index.html,French Laundry restaurateur Thomas Keller sues insurer for coronavirus losses,"Keller's attorney says the suit against insurer Hartford Fire Insurance Company -- and other similar challenges filed by restaurant owners -- is intended to establish legal precedent so that businesses facing mandated coronavirus closures are covered by their business interruption insurance policies.  Matthew Sturdevant, a spokesperson for The Hartford, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The suit was brought by French Laundry Partners, LP and Keller's restaurant group. The lawsuit was first reported by Restaurant Hospitality.  Keller is one of America's most-decorated chefs, and his restaurants have received numerous awards and accolades. He's the first American-born chef with two restaurants simultaneously achieving three-star ratings from the Michelin Guide. Keller's group has about a dozen restaurants in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and Yountville, Calif.  His is not the only challenge by a restaurant regarding coronavirus-related insurance coverage. New Orleans seafood restaurant Oceana Grill made a similar move earlier this month in asking a Louisiana court to make a declaratory judgment that its insurance policy with Lloyd's of London covers civil authority-ordered closures. The American Property Casualty Insurance Association this week said it believes that most insurance policies -- including those with business interruption coverage -- do not cover viruses such as Covid-19 and that to ""retroactively rewrite existing insurance policies"" could put the insurance industry at risk.  One estimate by the association found that small business' potential continuity losses could total $220 billion to $383 billion per month, which would quickly consume the estimated $800 billion surplus US insurers have for payouts.  ""If policymakers force insurers to pay for losses that are not covered under existing insurance policies, the stability of the sector could be impacted and that could affect the ability of consumers to address everyday risks that are covered by the property casualty industry,"" David A. Sampson, president and CEO of the association, said in a statement. John Houghtaling, the attorney representing both Keller and Oceana Grill, told CNN Business that ""It's become clear the insurance companies were not going to honor these policies."" Houghtaling, managing partner of Gauthier, Houghtaling LLP, referenced a posting made earlier this month by a catastrophe litigation attorney with Zelle LLP, a boutique law firm that focuses on insurance-related matters. The attorney wrote that unless policies specifically outline non-physical damage coverage, businesses ""are unlikely to find relief within the four corners of their policies.""  Houghtaling disagreed with the assessment. ""They're wrongfully denying us, which is going to cripple millions of people and their livelihoods,"" he said. ",3/28/2020

Reports of OneWeb's financial woes have been circulating for weeks, even as the company made its first significant strides in building its satellite internet constellation. The startup was reportedly in talks with Softbank to secure new funding, but the negotiations fell apart just hours before OneWeb launched its second large batch of 34 satellites into orbit on Saturday, according to a Financial Times report that was confirmed by CNN Business. OneWeb did not comment on specific fundraising efforts, but the company said in a statement that it has been ""engaged in advanced negotiations regarding investment that would fully fund the company through its deployment and commercial launch."" But those plans ""did not progress because of the financial impact and market turbulence related to the spread of COVID-19,"" the statement reads. Softbank did not respond to inquiries from CNN Business.  OneWeb, which employs about 500 people and recently opened a sprawling satellite factory in Florida, also confirmed this week that it was forced to lay off about 10% of its workforce, which it also attributed to the ""global health and economic crisis,"" according to a separate statement. OneWeb raised more than $3 billion, mostly from high-profile investors including Softbank, Airbus (EADSF), Richard Branson's Virgin Group, Coca-Cola  (KO)and Qualcomm (QCOM). And the company was once seen as a forerunner in the race to blanket the world in Internet connectivity using hundreds of satellites that orbit just a few hundred miles above ground.  But it faced stiff competition. Elon Musk's SpaceX, which brings in revenue from its rocket launch business and raised more than a billion dollars last year, is the clear leader. The company's Internet constellation, dubbed Starlink, already consists of more than 300 satellites. Musk has said the venture could start delivering service to customers as soon as this summer. Other satellite ventures pursing high-speed internet constellations include Amazon (AMZN), Canada's Telesat and, reportedly, Apple. It's not clear, however, if any of these plans will be successful. Several ventures, including one backed by Microsoft (MSFT) multibillionaire Bill Gates, attempted to build similar satellite-internet constellations in decades past. All of them either folded, filed for bankrupt, or drastically restructured their business plans. SpaceX, Amazon and others are attempting to succeed where others have failed. But they still face financial and technical hurdles. They must take on the steep costs of mass producing satellites and firing them into space without running out of money — and then they must be able to deliver their services at a price that makes sense for their customers. OneWeb's story is similar to its predecessors: The company began by touting bold plans to deliver low-cost service to billions of people around the globe that still lack reliable Internet access. But as it faced mounting costs and delays while developing its technology, OneWeb shifted its focus to corporate customers, with plans to beam Internet to ships and airplanes. SpaceX is still pledging it will bring Starlink service directly to consumers. However, it has yet to demonstrate it can produce affordable user terminals, which would use complex antennas to set up usable internet connections on the ground.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,Economists and investors are flying blind through a pandemic,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. Take the monthly US jobs report, which is due out for March this Friday. In normal times, it provides crucial information: How many jobs were added to the economy? What's the unemployment rate? Did wages go up? A vital snapshot of America's economic health, it's usually a must-read. But because the survey was conducted in the second week of March, before many of the shutdowns aimed at controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus came into effect, it's already outdated. ""This is not a normal recession that builds and spreads through time,"" Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, told me. ""Rather, it's an incredibly synchronized event with the government as a conductor."" Recessions, Wolfers noted, generally unfold over a period of months or quarters. This time, the economic blow from the pandemic, and efforts to contain it, has been instant. What it means: The first instructive jobs report won't arrive until early May. The upcoming read of US GDP that covers January through March will be similarly unhelpful. ""We had a lot of strength in January and February which is going to mask, to some degree, the carnage in March,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told me. Even the weekly readout of Americans who filed for their first week of unemployment benefits has limited utility. Last week, the US government reported that a shocking 3.3 million people filed initial claims, smashing records. The previous high was 695,000 claims filed in October 1982. But the number is so outside normal bounds that it's almost impossible to put into context, Wolfers said.  If the current rate of initial unemployment claims continues for eight weeks, job losses will be on par with the Great Recession, he calculated. If it spikes for just two weeks, however, the coronavirus recession will be extremely sharp but ultimately less severe. It all comes down the path the virus and governments take, which remains uncertain. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, told me that investors are relying on more unorthodox data as a result, such as the number of passengers traveling through security at US airports. He and Sonders both said they'd been keeping an eye on restaurant capacity via booking website Open Table. In the United States, it's been down 100% year-over-year for more than a week, with eateries closed in cities like New York and San Francisco. ""We have to turn to indicators that we had not looked at before,"" Slok said. ""We just don't have the luxury of waiting."" Markets remain under pressure US stocks staged a three-day rally last week in anticipation of the $2 trillion relief package just signed by President Donald Trump. Though the S&P 500 snapped the streak on Friday, it still finished the week up more than 10% — its strongest weekly gain since October 2008. But markets remain under strain. See here: Money market funds have experienced record inflows over the past two weeks, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. These funds are treated by investors like savings accounts. ""This reflects a broader move toward liquidity and cash-like investments amid uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Shelly Antoniewicz, ICI's senior director of financial and industry analysis, told me. Both top-rated and riskier corporate bond funds were hit again last week as investors worried about a raft of downgrades and defaults. It was the fourth week of outflows in a row, according to Bank of America. ""The pace has arguably decelerated, but outflows are still very sizable,"" the bank's credit strategists told clients on Friday.  And it's worth remembering that the S&P 500 still hasn't left bear market territory. The index is down 25% from its high in mid-February.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/tech/instacart-strike-hand-sanitizer-tips/index.html,Instacart makes more changes ahead of planned worker strike ,"Instacart said Sunday that it will soon begin making hand sanitizer available to its ""full service shoppers,"" who shop and deliver groceries for the company. It is also making it easier for customers to set their own default tipping percentage in the app. Instacart is one of several companies delivering essentials to households and now expanding rapidly at a time when much of the American economy is at risk of contracting. Last week, the company announced plans to bring on another 300,000 ""full service shoppers"" in North America over the next three months to service demand. But while the company has seen a surge in customer orders in recent weeks and introduced an option for customers to have orders left at their doorsteps, workers have criticized the company for not doing enough for them. The strike, which is being called for by Instacart shoppers and a newly formed non-profit called Gig Workers Collective, has a list of demands including providing workers with safety items including hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and sprays, hazard pay, and an expansion of its coronavirus pay to include those with underlying health conditions. The workers specified in a Medium post that they wanted an extra $5 per order and a default tip of at least 10% of the order total. The company has offered up to 14 days of pay for any hourly employee or full-service shopper who is diagnosed with coronavirus. After Gig Workers Collective posted demands Friday, Instacart extended the deadline to apply for these benefits to May 6. It also added contactless alcohol delivery and additional bonuses for its in-store shoppers, who are employees, but not for ""full service shoppers"" who are treated as independent contractors.  Instacart said the hand sanitizer, which it worked with a third party to manufacture, will be at no cost to shoppers and will be available to order via its website beginning Monday. Meanwhile, the new default tip will not set a minimum of 10% as workers have called for, but it will replace the previous 5% tip default setting to whatever the customer last chose to tip a worker.",3/29/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/28/media/information-coronavirus-reliable-sources/index.html,Here's how to debunk coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories from friends and family ,"Misinformation and family While the coronavirus pandemic has isolated family and friends inside their homes, it has in many cases increased online or over-the-phone communication with loved ones. For instance, that my family's iMessage group chain has never been busier. Relatives are checking up on each other, sharing updates, and providing some much-needed comic relief. But, in some cases, relatives and friends share poor information -- whether it is bad science related to how to prevent the virus, debunked rumors about cities being put on lockdown, or conspiracy theories about the origins of Covid-19. While any strain of misinformation is not ideal, misinformation related to a public health crisis has an especially dangerous element to it.   NYT's Rukmini Callimachi put it this way earlier in the week: ""I admit that it was mildly amusing when family members, who don't understand where to get verified news, fell for wacko conspiracies. Like the idea 9/11 was an inside job or that the moon landing was fake. We're now at a point where misinformation may cost [people] their lives."" Indeed, bad information during a public health emergency poses a risk to those who fall victim to it. So you will likely have the urge and feel the responsibility to correct it. But it can be incredibly awkward to correct misinformation or debunk conspiracy theories when it is being shared by a relative or good friend. So what's the best approach to take? Some experts gave their advice...  Know this: People want to share accurate information Before taking any action, it is important to remember that most people have no intention of sharing bad information. In fact, most people want to do the exact opposite of that. ""The research,"" MIT professor David Rand, who studies misinformation, told me, ""suggests that people really do want to share only accurate information. ... The people on your family group chain, most social media users want to only be sharing stuff that's accurate."" So why do people share bad information? They might not know better, and the type of content circulating during a health emergency might make them less judicious, Rand said: ""There's evidence that more emotionally evocative content makes people less discerning. In particular, when people rely on intuition and emotion they are more likely to believe false claims. Statements, for example, that are scary make people less inclined to stop and think about it.""   Be empathetic ""The first step is to have a sense of empathy,"" BuzzFeed reporter Craig Silverman, who has reported on false news for years, told me. Silverman noted that people are sharing information because they care and are either trying to help or feel like they are part of a larger conversation. ""People, especially family and friends in group chats,"" he noted, ""they are not trying to be malicious."" Emily Vraga, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies health misinformation, told me that research she has conducted has indicated that a blunt factual correction is ""equally as effective"" as one in which the person takes a more empathetic approach. ""So I think using that affirmative empathetic tone is better because the correction still works and it doesn't make [the person you're correcting] feel thrown under the bus,"" she said.   Cite authoritative sources  Another thing to keep in mind is the source you are using to correct the misinformation. For instance, your Trump-supporting uncle might be less inclined to believe outlets he perceives as critical of the President. ""If it comes from a news outlet they don't like, they're not going to respond well,"" Silverman pointed out, suggesting people consider citing sources like the CDC. Because some people might be skeptical of even the federal government, Vraga recommended citing local sources. That could include the state or city health department, or local media outlets that might appear more credible to the person you are trying to communicate with.   Talk one-on-one  Rand said research indicates that people ""are more receptive to corrections that come from their friends and family compared to random people."" That said, he noted you ""want to use language that communicates you are trying to be helpful"" and not confrontational. Silverman suggested if you have a family member or friend who has shared bad information that it might be better to reach out privately. ""Maybe send them a message and say, 'Hey, I noticed you just posted this. I have seen some information that seems to contradict this.' Think about how you can take it one-on-one in a personal way and provide them information from a source they are likely to trust.""   ""Pre-bunking"" instead of de-bunking  Rand emphasized that his research indicated that ""when people stop and think about things, they are actually very good at telling what is true and what is not true, but just not in terms of what they share."" Rand added, ""If you just nudge people to think a little more about accuracy, it can have a real impact.""  Rand's point was that it can be beneficial to focus on helping take preventative measures, instead of repeatedly dealing with debunking. He called it ""pre-bunking."" So how do you do it? ""Find some true pieces of information,"" Rand advised. ""Then say, 'Hey, I found this from the World Health Organization. What do you think?' And then people will read that and it will get them to think about accuracy and sources.""   You have a responsibility  One thing everyone agreed on: You have a responsibility to help correct bad information. ""When the misinformation can literally damage people's health, I do think we all have a responsibility,"" Silverman noted. ""You don't want people to be doing things that are bad for them or bad for society,"" added Rand. And Vraga acknowledged it is not always easy to correct close family or friends. ""These are relationships we care about, people whose good opinion we want to maintain and carry forward,"" Vraga said. But she said, ""It's a way of looking out for each other, and it can be uncomfortable in the moment, but hopefully in the long-run it's doing more good than harm."" Reminder: Some Americans ""still think this is a media hoax"" Brian Stelter writes: CNN contributor and WIRED writer Garrett Graff, who recently published an oral history of 9/11, is working on a week-by-week ""Covid Spring"" oral history for WIRED. The first two installments are out now. Graff told me he was struck by ""the number of people"" who took Trump seriously when the president was ""downplaying this threat for the first chunk of this year."" Even now, he said, some people ""still think this is a media hoax that is playing out...""",3/29/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/business/cheesecake-factory-april-rent-coronavirus/index.html,Cheesecake Factory tells its landlords it won't be able to pay April rent,"Regulations instituted across several states forced restaurants to close as a way to help stop the spread of the virus. The closures have resulted in a significant revenue decrease for the company.  In a letter addressed to the company's landlords, CEO David Overton wrote that the ""severe decrease in restaurant traffic has severely decreased our cash flow and inflicted a tremendous financial blow to our business."" The letter was first obtained by Eater and the company confirmed its authenticity to CNN Business. The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) also owns a number of other restaurants including North Italia, Flower Child and Culinary Dropout. Some restaurants have remained open for delivery and take-out options. ""Please understand that we do not take this action or make this decision lightly, and while we hope to resume our rent payments as soon as reasonably possible, we simply cannot predict the extent or the duration of the current crisis,"" Overton wrote in the letter. Many Cheesecake Factory restaurants are located in or near malls, which have also been forced to close in several states. Large mall owners Simon and Westfield didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter.  Matthew Clark, chief financial officer for the Cheesecake Factory, said in a statement to CNN Business that the company has ""very strong, longstanding relationships"" with its landlords.  ""We are certain that with their partnership, we will be able to work together to weather this storm in the appropriate manner,"" Clark said.  The coronavirus pandemic has been a shock to casual dining chains because of the sudden closures and lack of clarity about when they can reopen.  That business model is now a liability. These days, those chains have to quickly figure out ways to ramp up off-site orders while keeping their companies afloat.  ""Most of the bigger players will find a way to survive,""  R.J. Hottovy, a consumer strategist for Morningstar previously told CNN Business. But ""it's not going to be easy."" -- CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",3/29/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/regional-airlines-halt-operations-coronavirus/index.html,Hundreds of US cities could be without air travel if small airlines go under,"The group representing these carriers, the Regional Airline Association, says the closures are only the beginning. The airline bailout bill, as currently written, won't help small carriers, it said,  and the sector could be wiped out by the crisis.  That would leave hundreds of smaller cities served only by  regional jets with very limited air service -- or perhaps none at all.  ""We could be on the cusp of fundamentally changing the air transportation system in the United States,"" said Faye Malarkey Black, the CEO of the Regional Airline Association. ""History says once a city loses service, it doesn't come back. These are the first shutdowns, but if we don't get the help, and get it fast, this definitely won't be the last."" The two regional airlines fly smaller jets to small and mid-size cities. Bakersfield, California, Abiline, Texas, State College, Pennsylvania and Kalamazoo and Battle Creek, Michigan are among the cities that get all their service from regional airlines. Many other cities -- from Tallahassee, Florida to Eugene, Oregon, --get almost all their service from regional carriers.  Those cities are very much at risk of losing their service in the crisis, according to Black. ""That's the historical pattern, when there's a downturn, the smaller communities are the ones that lose service first,"" said Black. The carriers shutting down are Compass Airlines, which will halt its Delta Connection operations on April 1 and its American Eagle flights on April 7. Trans States Airlines, which has common ownership with Compass, will shut its United Express operations on April 1.  Before the current crisis, the two carriers had 2,700 employees and flew nearly 10 million passengers annually on more than 500 daily flights to about 100 cities. But those two carriers are a small but crucial segment of the US airline industry. All told, regional airlines carried 159 million passengers last year on more than 10,000 daily flights, or about 40% of the total number of US flights. Together they employed 59,000 workers last year. And it isn't just the smaller cities that are served by the regional carriers. Some routes may go to cities where a larger airline wants to provide service, but there isn't enough demand for a full size jet. Many regional carriers fly between major cities, such as New York to Columbus, Ohio, or Atlanta to Denver. Passenger traffic has plunged in the face of the virus outbreak, as public health officials advise Americans to stay home when possible, avoid groups of more than 10 people and eliminate non-essential travel.  Major airlines such American and United, which book their passengers on the regional airlines, have slashed schedules by about half and what planes are flying have only 20% to 30% of seats sold, according to some estimates.  That has left smaller carriers reeling. ""Radical capacity reductions left Compass without the ability to fly even minimally viable schedules,"" said Trans States spokesperson Cartiay McCoy.  Even before the coronavirus crisis, regional carriers were having difficulty filling their staffing needs. Trans States was planning to shut down entirely at the end of 2020 due a pilot shortage.  Compass was likewise going to wind down its Delta service later this year, but was looking for a replacement agreement with another airline.  The coronavirus sped up the demise of both small carriers. There is no prospect of relief from the federal government. The proposed bailout does not include the tens of billions in cash grants that the airline industry requested, and includes only loan guarantees that must be secured by assets such as planes. Most regional airlines don't own the planes they fly for the mainline carriers, and are unable to borrow money even with the federal guarantees, Black said. ""This form [of bailout] does us no good,"" said Black, association's CEO. ""We need our partners to be healthy, but we need lawmakers to understand that we're a distinct business and any support needs to works for the regional airlines."" Airline consultant Mike Boyd said that many of the smaller airports that will likely lose service were already at risk, partly because potential passengers were often willing to drive up to 90 minutes away to a bigger airport with more choices. ""Will communities lose air service? The local airport may, but many consumers will not,"" Boyd said. ",3/29/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/business/airlines-bailouts/index.html,Most airlines could be bankrupt by May. Governments will have to help,"Airlines across the world are grounding planes, laying off workers and scrambling to preserve cash as measures to contain the outbreak prompt flight bans and wipe out global travel demand.  The three biggest global airline alliances, oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance, urged governments to ""evaluate all possible means"" to assist the industry. They represent more than 58 of the world's leading carriers. Some European airlines have already issued urgent appeals for help. According to CAPA Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May unless governments intervene. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed — now — if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" the firm said in a report published Monday. ""Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded, and what flights there are operate much less than half full,"" it added. The scale of the deepening crisis was underscored Monday when Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, Ryanair (RYAAY), said that it will ground most of its fleet over the next seven to 10 days.  ""In those countries where the fleet is not grounded, social distancing restrictions may make flying to all intents and purposes, impractical, if not, impossible,"" the airline said, adding that it now expected to reduce seat capacity by 80% for April and May, and could not rule out complete grounding of its fleet of 470 planes. ""The demand for international air travel is essentially non-existent,"" Scandinavian Airlines said Sunday. Lufthansa (DLAKY), which owns national carriers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium, said the group's airlines are in discussions with their respective governments about ""receiving active government support should this become necessary."" One of its subsidiaries, Austrian Airlines, is temporarily suspending all flights starting March 19.    Sweeping capacity cuts Most of the world's biggest airlines have announced dramatic reductions to schedules and have idled hundreds of planes. Employees have been asked to take voluntary unpaid leave, while senior executives take pay cuts, in the face of the worst aviation crisis in history. American Airlines (AAL) said Saturday it would reduce its international capacity by three quarters between March 16 and May 6. United Airlines said it will be cutting capacity in half for April and May, while Delta (DAL) is reducing capacity by 40% in the next few months — the largest cut in the company's history. Delta is down to just one flight a day on five European routes.  Governments are now facing calls from airlines for financial assistance. The US airlines' trade group made an appeal for a federal bailout worth about $50 billion on Monday.  It is a stunning reversal from less than a week ago when top executives at an investor conference on March 10 insisted they were not counting on a federal help. But that was before President Donald Trump banned travel from most of Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as a sharp decline in domestic air travel in the United States. Virgin Atlantic, which has asked staff to take two months unpaid leave, said in a statement Monday that the United Kingdom's aviation sector alone will need government support of between £5 billion and £7.5 billion ($6.1 billion and $9.2 billion). Heavily indebted budget carrier, Norwegian Air said Friday that it needed urgent help from government to strengthen its cash position. ""We welcome the fact that the government has decided to remove aviation taxes in Norway, but sadly, this is not enough as we're in a very demanding situation at the moment,"" it said in a statement, asking government to ramp up its response. The company said Monday that it will ""gradually cancel"" most of its flights and temporarily lay off 90% of its workforce, or about 7,300 people. ""European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives,"" Johan Lundgren, CEO of low-cost carrier EasyJet  (ESYJY)said in a statement Monday. The International Air Transport Association said last week that airlines will need ""emergency measures to get through the crisis,"" urging governments to consider extending lines of credit, reducing infrastructure costs and easing taxes. IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac has previously raised the possibility of direct government bailouts for airlines, similar to what took place in the United States after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the US federal government approved $5 billion in direct support and $10 billion in loan guarantees for the industry. Labor unions on both sides of the Atlantic are pleading for governments to step in. United's pilots union said Sunday there will be a ""call to action"" this week to ask the US administration to help, while Britain's pilots union said without ""significant government support now there may not be a UK aviation industry left.""  There are about 460,000 jobs in the US airline industry, according to the Labor Department, and most of these are well paid with healthy benefits. Britain's biggest labor union on Monday appealed to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to implement an ""urgent comprehensive financial package"" to cover worker pay and extend loans to airlines and airports, or ""tens of thousands of jobs"" would be at risk. When deciding on which carriers to prioritize, governments in Europe will need to consider which airlines play a vital function in the economy, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said Monday. These are more likely to be the legacy carriers than budget airlines, which are focused mostly on leisure travel, he added.  British Airways parent, IAG (ICAGY) was unlikely to approach government for support, given its strong cash position, Roeska said. CAPA Centre for Aviation said the nature of the crisis required a global, coordinated response but said it believed that was unlikely to happen.  ""It will consist mostly of bailing out selected national airlines. If that is the default position, emerging from the crisis will be like entering a brutal battlefield, littered with casualties,"" the firm said. — Eoin McSweeney and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",3/29/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/business/us-airlines-federal-bailout/index.html,US airline industry seeks about $50 billion in federal help,"The requested aid would be in the form of loans, grants and tax relief. The airlines are looking for up to $25 billion in grants for passenger air carriers and $4 billion in grants to cargo carriers, and the same amounts in loans or loan guarantees, Airlines for America outlined in a briefing document.  ""US carriers are in need of immediate assistance as the current economic environment is simply not sustainable,"" the group said in a statement. ""This is compounded by the fact that the crisis does not appear to have an end in sight.""  The US airlines are not the only ones asking for help from their national governments in the face of the sharp decline in travel. Monday the three biggest global airline alliances, oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance, urged governments around the world to ""evaluate all possible means"" to assist the industry. They represent more than 58 of the world's leading carriers.  The US aid package has been discussed with key lawmakers and staff, as on Capitol Hill and the Trump administration, two sources said.  The discussions were described as early-stage. But one source noted there is a growing recognition from the federal government that conditions ""are getting very bad, very fast.""  In addition the request to help the airlines, a trade group for the nation's airports is requesting a separate $10 billion bailout, an airport industry source told CNN. The request for help is in line with anticipated airport revenue declines tied to the sharp drop in revenue that comes from airlines slashing their flight schedules. Most of the fees airlines pay to airports are based on the number of flights that  take off and land.  The plane manufacturer Boeing on Monday also said it is talking to ""government and industry leaders."" ""We're leveraging all our resources to sustain our operations,"" said spokesperson Gordon Johndroe. ""Meanwhile, ready short term access to public and private liquidity will be one of the most important ways for airlines, airports, suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery, and we appreciate how the Administration and Congress are engaging with all elements of the aviation industry during this difficult time."" 'We're going to help them' Most of America's major airlines are projected to run out of cash some time between June 30 and the end of the year without help, according to Airlines for America. But the crisis may actually be more pressing than that. If the nation's credit card companies start to withhold payments to the airlines out of fear that there could be bankruptcy filings that would turn them into creditors, the airlines could run out of cash before June 30, according to the trade group. The concept of a bailout for airlines got an endorsement from President Donald Trump at his briefing on the virus on Monday. ""We're going to back the airlines 100%,"" said Trump, saying that their financial problems is ""not their fault. It's nobody's fault."" ""We're going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We've told the airlines we're going to help them. It's very important."" Stunning reversal The need for the bailout is a stunning reversal of position for the industry and a sign of just how quickly the demand for air travel in the nation has ground to a near halt. When airline executives met at the White House with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on March 4, they did not ask for a bailout. And as recently as Tuesday, executives from most of the nation's airlines told investors at a JPMorgan online investor conference that they were not seeking any kind of government assistance. ""We are not going to count on any kind of government intervention,"" said United Airlines President Scott Kirby at the time. But on Sunday night Kirby and United CEO Oscar Munoz told United's 100,000 employees that the airline would cut capacity by 50% in April and May, and it expected that only 20% to 30% of the seats on those remaining planes would be filled.  That is far, far below what United needs to break even. In 2019 the carrier filled 84% of the seats it sold. On Sunday, United management started discussions with the airline's unions on ways to cut compensation costs, the largest expense at the airline. It has already offered unpaid leave to employees and it may have to make changes to pay rates or furloughs. The pilots union at United said in a letter to its membership that it will work with management to limit the losses in order to protect ""the financial future of our airline."" But it also said that the unions and management would announce a ""call for action"" this week to seek government assistance. A critical industry The discussions on possible help for the airlines has been fast moving, sources tell CNN. ""This is a roller coaster, and discussions are evolving by the hour,"" one source familiar with the discussions told CNN. The source said that they are hoping that there is an agreement over the package over the next days and weeks, not months. They are hoping that by having laid out their request, they can speed up the process. There are about 460,000 jobs in the US airline industry, according to the Labor Department, and most of them provide good pay and strong benefits. The industry is  crucial for the efficient functioning of the US economy, not only enabling business travel but also leisure travel, which itself is a major sector of the US economy. Commercial aviation taxes and fees reached $26 billion in 2019, or about $71 million per day, according to Airlines for America, the trade group for the domestic industry.  Billions of that total are paid by airline passengers, not the airlines, although lifting fees and taxes would reduce the price of airline tickets and could spur increased demand.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/28/tech/instacart-planned-strike/index.html,Instacart shoppers plan strike over treatment during pandemic,"The strike is being called for by Instacart shoppers and a newly formed non-profit called Gig Workers Collective. It was first reported Friday by Vice. ""Instacart has still not provided essential protections to Shoppers on the front lines that could prevent them from becoming carriers, falling ill themselves, or worse,"" Instacart Shoppers and Gig Workers Collective wrote in a Medium blog post. Instacart is one of several companies delivering essentials to households and now expanding rapidly at a time when much of the American economy is at risk of contracting. Amazon and Walmart each recently announced they plan to hire at least 100,000 workers due to increased customer demand. Yet, there are concerns about whether companies are doing enough for workers, who are the backbone of the services they offer, during this unprecedented public health crisis. While Instacart has touted its surge in customer orders in recent weeks and introduced an option for customers to have orders left at their doorsteps, workers have criticized the company for not doing enough for them. Demands include providing workers with safety items including hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and sprays, hazard pay, and an expansion of its coronavirus pay to include those with underlying health conditions. The workers specified in the Medium post that they wanted an extra $5 per order and a default tip of at least 10% of the order total. The company has offered up to 14 days of pay for any hourly employee or full-service shopper who is diagnosed with Covid-19. After workers made demands, the company extended the deadline to apply for these benefits to May 6. It also added contactless alcohol delivery and additional promotions and bonuses for employees. ""The health and safety of our entire community — shoppers, customers, and employees — is our first priority,"" said Instacart in a statement Saturday. ""We want to underscore that we absolutely respect the rights of shoppers to provide us feedback and voice their concerns. It's a valuable way for us to continuously make improvements to the shopper experience."" The grocery delivery company announced last Monday that it plans to add another 300,000 ""full-service shoppers"" in North America over the next three months in response to overwhelming demand spurred by coronavirus. These workers shop and make deliveries for customers and are treated as independent contract workers by Instacart. ""The last few weeks have been the busiest in Instacart's history and our teams are working around the clock to reliably and safely serve all members of our community,"" said Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta in a statement last Monday.",3/29/2020

The company has appointed Teri Gendron, CFO of Jefferies Financial Group, as the interim CFO and chief accounting officer of Jefferies Group (JEF).  ""For over a dozen years, Peg has been our CFO and partner, and helped us build Jefferies from less than half its current size, and navigate through hard times and good times,"" the company said.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/media/fox-news-trump/index.html,Trump is self-isolating at his safe space: Fox News,"On Monday morning he called into ""Fox & Friends,"" one of his most reliable sources of support, and praised his own response to the pandemic. It was Trump's third interview on Fox in the past week, and it was more of the same: He talked for 54 minutes with hardly a tough question or assertive follow-up. If the ratings-conscious president had wanted to reach a bigger audience, he would have called into the ""Today"" show or ""Good Morning America."" If he had wanted to be heard on the global stage, he would have granted an interview to CNN. His decision to stay on Fox suggest he wants to shore up his base — and avoid difficult questioning. To be fair, Trump has been participating in near-daily briefings at the White House with members of his coronavirus task force. He has quarreled with multiple reporters at the briefings and bristled when they pressed him about his handling of the crisis. But the briefing dynamic is different than a traditional interview. As the crisis has deepened and the death toll has risen, Trump's only national TV interviews have been with Fox News. He sat down for a ""virtual town hall"" with Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer at the White House on March 24. Fox anchor Harris Faulkner also participated remotely. Hemmer and Faulkner were widely criticized for letting Trump repeat falsehoods without fact-checking or follow-ups. Two days later, Trump called into Hannity's prime time show for a 40-minute chat. He claimed he postponed a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in order to talk with Hannity.  ""That shows the power of ... that shows you have the No. 1 rated show on television,"" Trump said. Hannity's program often rates No. 1 on cable television, but not on television overall. Numerous broadcast news programs have far bigger audiences, like ""60 Minutes"" and ""World News Tonight."" But the president would face some serious questioning on those shows. So he steers clear -- even when the United States is suffering through one of the toughest stretches in its history.  He has turned down all interview requests from CNN. ",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/media/donald-trump-tv-ratings-reliable-sources/index.html,"As coronavirus death toll rises, Trump focuses on a different set of numbers: TV ratings  ","Numbers that matter right now: The rapidly rising death toll. The projections of additional potential deaths in the weeks ahead. The length of time until the expected peak. The death rate. The number of confirmed cases. The number of people who have Covid-19 symptoms, but haven't been tested. The number of 911 calls in major metro areas like New York. The staffing levels at area hospitals. The number of available beds. The number of additional beds that may be needed. The current count of ventilators. The supplies of PPE. The capacity levels of local morgues. The unemployment rate. The length of time that social distancing measures will remain in effect. The modeled death toll if the restrictions are eased.   Numbers that don't matter right now: Television ratings. That's why it was so disgusting to see President Trump bragging about the ratings for the White House's coronavirus task force briefings. Talking about ratings while people are dying and others are pleading for help? It is beneath any human being. I said on ""CNN Newsroom"" that members of Trump's inner circle need to intervene and help him get out of his own way. But I'm not holding my breath. Trump launched into an anti-CNN tirade during a Sunday afternoon presser, claiming that the network is ""not trusted anymore"" and that ""people are not watching CNN anymore."" Again let me say: TV ratings don't matter right now. Viewership is up, across the board, but networks are wary of publicizing the numbers for the same reasons that they didn't tout their record ratings after 9/11. I'm not going to get into all the specific metrics. But for purposes of fact-checking the president's lie, the month of March has been CNN's most-watched month since September 2005, when the Gulf Coast was recovering from Hurricane Katrina. As an anchor and correspondent, I feel the pressure. I know that our ratings are well above average right now. People need reliable sources that aren't minimizing OR overstating the threat. That's what we have to keep doing. That's something the president should encourage, not seek to destroy. Ratings reality check Brian Lowry writes: It seems ridiculous to have to point this out right now, but here goes: Trump has a long history of exaggerating or outright lying about TV ratings, dating back to his claims that ""The Apprentice"" was the No. 1 show on TV long after it wasn't.

Watch...   Trump lashes out at Alcindor, demands she ""be nice"" Oliver Darcy writes: Amid a global pandemic killing thousands of Americans, Trump disparaged CNN, NYT, and PBS at his press conference on Sunday, while saving his praise for a fringe right-wing network that has a history of peddling conspiracy theories. Trump lashed out at PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and said she should be friendlier toward him. Trump's outburst came after Alcindor noted that Trump had previously told Sean Hannity he was not sure if states would actually need the total number of ventilators they have requested. ""Why don't you act a little more positive?"" Trump asked. He added, ""Be nice. Don't be threatening. Be nice."" Alcindor pushed back, noting she was effectively repeating what he had previously told Hannity, but Trump wasn't having it. When Alcindor came to ask her second Q, Trump cut her off and the microphone was taken away from her...   Diamond gives back the mic Darcy continues: When Trump called on him later in the press conference, CNN's Jeremy Diamond instead handed Alcindor the mic so that she could ask her second question. Alcindor asked which health experts Trump had spoken to that had said more people could die from an economic recession than the virus. Trump didn't directly answer. After the press conference, Alcindor tweeted, ""I'm not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward."" ""These are direct quotes, sir."" Darcy adds: When Diamond got a chance to ask his question, he pressed Trump on last Friday comments about not phoning governors who are not ""appreciative."" Trump accused Diamond of lying and taking him out of context, but Diamond pointed out that he was reading ""direct quotes.""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/investing/macys-employees-furlough-coronavirus/index.html,"Macy's will furlough the majority of its 125,000 employees","The company said Monday that the pandemic has taken a ""heavy toll"" on its business. Macy's (M), which also owns Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, closed all of its 775 stores in the United States earlier this month to slow the virus from spreading in crowded areas, and because of laws in some states that forced the closure of nonessential businesses, including retailers.  Macy's painted a bleak picture of its already perilous financial situation. The company said that it has lost a ""majority"" of sales because of the brick-and-mortar closures and has implemented other changes to bolster its bottom line, including drawing down its credit line and freezing hiring and spending.  ""While these actions have helped, it is not enough,"" the company bluntly said. Macy's is ""moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations."" That is resulting in furloughs for a ""majority"" of its employees beginning this week. Affected workers will still get the company-funded health care for at least through May.  Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette and the company's board of directors will stop receiving their salaries, according to a regulatory filing. Macy's websites remain open for orders. The company will furlough fewer workers at its digital operations and distribution and call centers, Macy's said, but online sales make up just a fifth of Macy's overall revenue. ""We expect to bring colleagues back on a staggered basis as business resumes,"" the company said. However, its unclear when retailers will be allowed to open. President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's extending the nationwide social distancing guidelines until at least April 30.  The news is another blow for Macy's, which has already been reducing its store count as dwindling sales took hold in the US even before the coronavirus pandemic. Department stores have already been being squeezed by discount chains, like TJ Maxx  (TJX)and Target (TGT), which is pressuring profits and forcing them to put products on sale. Meanwhile, more shoppers are migrating online. Macy's shares fell 2% in early trading. The stock is down nearly 70% for the year.",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/investing/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-drugs/index.html,These companies are racing to roll out COVID-19 treatments,"Several high profile companies are working on new experimental vaccines. Drug giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is the latest to announce a promising vaccine candidate, saying on Monday that it plans human testing by September with the hopes of having more than one billion doses of a vaccine available for emergency use by early 2021. J&J said it was partnering with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to produce the vaccine. Shares of J&J surged nearly 7% on the news Monday. Many other companies are also working on vaccines, including small biotechs Moderna (MRNA), Novavax (NVAX) and Inovio (INO) as well as Big Pharma firm Pfizer (PFE), which is partnering with Germany's BioNTech (BNTX). Shares of Moderna, Novavax, Inovio and BioNTech have all soared this year, even as the broader market has plunged due to worries about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. (Pfizer is down nearly 20%.) But making and testing new vaccines may not wind up being the fastest way to treat Covid-19, says Sergey Young, founder of the Longevity Vision Fund -- a firm that invests primarily in smaller private biotechs. Already developed drugs might work now as the world waits for a vaccine Some firms are hoping that existing medications for other infectious diseases and immunological disorders can be used to tackle the global pandemic. ""This is the first time in history where companies are trying to repurpose drugs this fast, and that is exciting,"" Young said. ""A vaccine is in the more distant future. We pray that one can come by the autumn.""  Young pointed to three drugs in particular that might wind up being effective in treating symptoms of Covid-19. The first -- and the one that has gotten the most attention -- is remdesivir, a drug made by Gilead Sciences (GILD) that was originally used for Ebola and other highly contagious diseases. Officials at the World Health Organization have touted remdesivir as having the most potential to effectively treat coronavirus patients. The WHO has begun clinical tests of the drug on patients in Spain and Norway.  ""Remdesivir is still an investigational medicine. We are planning for the outcome we all hope for -- that it will prove to be a safe, effective treatment -- and in the meantime we are taking the ethical, responsible approach to determining whether that is the case,"" said Gilead chairman and CEO Daniel O'Day in an open letter released Saturday. Longevity Vision Fund's Young added that two other medications could be helpful in treating coronavirus as well: the HIV medication Kaletra, which is produced by AbbVIe (ABBV) and is a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir; and Kevzara, and a rheumatoid arthritis treatment made by biotech Regeneron (REGN) and European drug titan Sanofi (SNY). (The reporter of this story owns shares of AbbVie.) Sanofi is also working on a vaccine with BARDA funding from the US government. Meanwhile, Chinese health officials have also been testing another rheumatoid arthritis drug -- Roche's Actemra -- on Covid-19 patients.  The hope is that one or more of these existing medications will help alleviate the worst symptoms from the coronavirus, buying more time for companies developing vaccines to come up with a longer term solution to stop the spread of the disease.",3/30/2020

Sales of pet supplies rose 24% during that stretch. Cheerios-maker General Mills (GIS), which also owns the Blue Buffalo pet food brand, noted last week that sales have spiked.  ""People love their pets and they want to make sure they take care of their pets,"" General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening told analysts. Pets are not eating more than they used to, analysts say. But their owners are panic buying for the long haul at big retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST), as well as at pet stores such Petco that remain open. Petco said its sales have increased as shoppers stock up on essentials.  A spokesperson for Petco defended the company's decision to stay open during the crisis, even as many other retailers close, noting that specialty retailers like Petco accounts for nearly a third of all dog and cat food sales in the United States and roughly half of fish and companion animal foods. ""Mass retailers and grocery stores simply can't feed all our pets,"" the spokesperson said. Shoppers are also buying in bulk for their pets online as their hunker down at home. ""Amazon (AMZN) and online pet supply retailer Chewy (CHWY) are ""benefiting as consumers shop from the confines of their homes,"" Moody's said in a report this week. Chewy is hiring 6,000 employees to keep pace with demand.  Wall Street has taken note of these changing shopping trends during the pandemic and demand for pet care.  Chewy's (CHWY) stock has rallied 10% over the last month, despite the broader market downturn. Shares of PetMed Express (PETS), the owner of online pet pharmacy 1800PetMeds, has gained 4%. The growing market for pet supplies and veterinary care has appealed to both traditional food manufacturers and retailers in recent years. Top food makers have bought up pet food brands, while retailers such as Walmart have expanded vet clinics in stores and launched an online pet pharmacy. Nearly 85 million US households — 67% of the country — have at least one pet, up from 73 million in 2010, according to the American Pet Products Association, an industry trade group.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/tech/instacart-amazon-worker-strikes/index.html,Here's why Amazon and Instacart workers are striking at a time when you need them most,"Some Instacart workers said they turned off their app Monday to call attention to their concerns around the company's treatment of workers during the public health crisis. Meanwhile, about 50 Amazon workers at its Staten Island facility protested just after noon amid allegations the company has mishandled its response to coronavirus. Amazon has confirmed two cases at this facility to CNN Business. One protestor carried a sign that read: ""Our health is just as essential."" The strikes highlight a fundamental tension in the tech industry right now: Business such as Amazon and Instacart are experiencing so much demand from customers wary of stepping outside that they have announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse workers and 300,000 shoppers, respectively. But the workers who are the backbone of these businesses have told CNN Business they believe both companies are not doing enough to protect them. Some Instacart workers plan to continue striking against the company until it meets their demands, which include hazard pay, expanding coronavirus sick pay to include coverage for those with underlying health conditions, and changing the default tip from 5% to 10% on all orders. Meanwhile, others told CNN Business they will continue working, citing fear of retaliation as well as an unwillingness to leave customers in the lurch. But they feel similarly that Instacart needs to improve worker conditions at a time when the importance of their jobs is felt by customers more than ever. ""Many of us are much more fearful for our lives than any retaliation this strike may bring,"" according to a statement from Gig Workers Collective, the newly formed non-profit leading the Instacart strike effort. ""Standing up for ourselves is always a gamble... but we're not scared."" In a statement to CNN Business about the strike, Instacart said, ""we've seen absolutely no impact to Instacart's operations. Today, we saw 40% more shoppers on the platform compared to the same day and time last week."" The company said it has had 250,000 new people sign up to work as independent contractors in the past week and 50,000 of them have already started doing so. ""We respect the rights of shoppers to provide us feedback and voice their concerns,"" the company said. Ahead of the strike, Instacart made some updates, including stating it would soon make hand sanitizer available for workers to order free of cost on its website. But workers told CNN Business the changes barely scratch the surface of their complaints. In addition to the organizers' demands, some Instacart workers said the company's pay structure means they can sometimes make as little as $5 to $7, not including tips or mileage, for fulfilling multiple orders. (Instacart said its minimums have been in place for more than a year and that workers can choose which jobs they want to take.) Some also expressed frustration that when issues arise, they sometimes wait hours -- which is unpaid time -- to get answers from the company's customer service department. They questioned how the company could add hundreds of thousands more workers when there's little support for the ones they already have. Instacart told CNN Business it is working to scale up its customer service team to meet the increased demand. It has also made some recent updates to preempt some common worker concerns, such as temporarily removing customer ratings so workers aren't penalized when high-demand items aren't found in stores. Amazon has faced criticism, as well. In interviews with CNN Business, Amazon workers have raised concerns about worker conditions at its warehouses around the country, including what they claim was pressure to work longer hours as well as a lack of worker screening for possible coronavirus symptoms, adequate social distancing measures and protective gear. Amazon warehouses are facing a growing tide of coronavirus cases with at least 13 facilities hit so far, according to Amazon and local media reports. A company spokesperson confirmed Monday that at least one worker has tested positive at its Kent, WA, and Eastvale, CA, facilities. Both Amazon and Instacart have announced policies offering some form of sick pay for those who fall ill with coronavirus or are placed into quarantine. For Instacart workers, it's unclear just how helpful that has been. According to Gig Workers Collective, a ""big push for the timing of this strike was seeing our fellow shoppers being denied the 'sick pay' offered by Instacart."" When asked about this, Instacart reiterated its policy on the matter and said it communicates with workers who have submitted documentation that doesn't meet its criteria in order to help them understand what is needed to qualify for the pay. ""Workers across the service industry are suffering. And yet they are indispensable during this critical time,"" said Veena Dubal, a labor law expert and associate professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. ""The fact that these strikes are happening simultaneously shows that if the companies don't meet their demands, workers have the power to shut down the supply chains.""   Dubal added: ""Consumers, too, are realizing how their well-being is intertwined with the well-being of people who do these jobs."" According to Amazon worker Christian Smalls, a process assistant at the Staten Island facility who led Monday's organizing effort, ""the plan is to cease all operations until the building is closed and sanitized.""  ""We're not asking for much,"" he told CNN Business on Sunday, claiming many more employees have tested positive for the virus at the facility than the company has publicly acknowledged. At the protest, one person chanted, ""How many cases we got?"" and workers replied ""Ten!"" When asked whether the facility had 10 cases, Amazon would not confirm nor deny the number. ""We're asking the building to be closed and sanitized, and for us to be paid [during that process],"" said Smalls. An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement Sunday evening that the company's top priority is the health and safety of its employees. ""We believe direct communication is the best avenue to discuss feedback, and our teams onsite are speaking directly with employees each day to hear their questions and discuss options that are available in this ever changing environment,"" the spokesperson said. Hours before the walkout, some employees at the facility received a text message notifying them that another worker, last in the facility on March 24, tested positive for coronavirus, one worker told CNN Business. ""We understand that you may be nervous about coming in to work,"" the message read. ""We have taken a number of measures to keep us safe, such as an increase in social distancing requirements to six feet, staggered shifts, extended breaks, and even more frequent cleanings."" Amazon confirmed the text is authentic. Still, some workers are on the fence about joining the strikes. Despite wanting to push for change, some can't afford to not work and feel conflicted about about its potential impact on regular households. ""People need to get their groceries and I don't want to hinder that, it isn't their fault,"" a worker for Instacart in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, told CNN Business. ""I delivered [Saturday] to a man whose wife has an autoimmune disorder and [needs] groceries delivered."" ",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/playstation-5-new-details-sony-trnd/index.html,Sony reveals technical specifications of the upcoming PlayStation 5,"Sony (SNE) wrote in a blog post that the PS5 is offering support for ""almost"" all of the top 100 PS4 titles and that it will continue to test and add more games from its library of more than 4,000 PS4 games. As announced last year, the PS5 is getting SSD storage for shorter loading time. The graphics chip has been bumped up for higher screen resolution and can support ray tracing, which adds more realistic shadow and lighting effects. The PlayStation 5 can support 4K gaming and even 8K, although 8K gaming has yet to gain traction given the challenges of loading graphic-intense games during fast-paced, interactive scenes. The PS5's 3D audio feature will make virtual raindrops sound like they're falling from different directions and can help players pinpoint where an in-game enemy is lurking. ""We had a dream of what might be possible five years from now,"" said Mark Cerny, lead system architect for the PS5, about the team's interest in 3D audio, during Sony's Wednesday livestream on YouTube (GOOG). The original talk was aimed at developers for the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco that was to take place this week. The conference was postponed over coronavirus concerns. Sony's announcement fell flat with consumers. Many YouTube comments complained that the developer-focused talk, math-heavy and jargon-filled, was boring. Some demanded the PlayStation 5 be released so they could simply buy the console without sitting through the talk. But hardware makers have to show off their new devices' capabilities to developers so they can build software that meets the specifications. The announcement came two days after Microsoft unveiled the technical specifications of its Xbox Series X. Although pricing is still unknown, Microsoft said the Series X's new features will  include support for 4K graphics at 60 to 120 frames per second, which allows games to appear smooth during even the most action packed scenes. Both the Series X and PlayStation 5 are slated for release this holiday season. Sony has said the PlayStation 5 will feature a redesigned controller. It will include haptic feedback and improved tactile sensations such as rumbling and shaking, allowing users to get more immersed in games.",3/30/2020

Brent crude, the world's benchmark, tumbled as much as 13% and fell to as low as $21.65 a barrel, its lowest point in 18 years. Brent settled at $22.76 a barrel, the lowest close since November 2002. The renewed selling in the oil patch underscores the unprecedented collapse in demand caused by the social distancing restrictions imposed by governments around the world. Highways are empty. Entire airlines are shutting down. Macy's (M) just furloughed a majority of its 125,000 workers. Factories large and small have halted production.  Global oil consumption will likely crater by 12 million barrels per day this quarter, or 12%, the steepest decline ever recorded, according to Bank of America.   ""It is very ugly and there is no way to sugarcoat it,"" Bank of America commodity analysts wrote in a Monday note to clients.   At the same time, Saudi Arabia and Russia are flooding the world with excess oil -- at exactly the time when the opposite approach is required. That price war is exacerbating the pain in the oil market.   Those two factors have driven US oil prices down by a stunning 68% since the recent peak of $63.27 a barrel in early January.  US gasoline demand could collapse by more than half The selling comes after President Donald Trump, heeding the advice of health experts, extended federal social distancing guidelines until April 30. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned on CNN the United States could see millions of coronavirus cases and 100,000 or more deaths.   That dire warning suggests the nightmare won't end anytime soon for the energy market.  IHS Markit estimates that US gasoline demand could collapse by as much as 4.1 million barrels per day -- or more than 50% -- during the coronavirus response period. That would easily surpass the demand destruction during the Great Recession.   And that's a big problem for oil because US gasoline is the No. 1 swing factor worldwide for oil demand.   Goldman Sachs head of commodities Jeffrey Currie called it the ""largest economic shock of our lifetimes"" and warned it is ""extremely negative"" for oil prices.  Sub-$2 gasoline prices That shock has amplified the epic battle between Russia and Saudi Arabia.  First, Russia refused to cut production despite the obvious need for less supply. That refusal is driven by its desire to drown high-cost US producers in a sea of cheap crude in hopes of recapturing market share.  Saudi Arabia responded by threatening to ramp up production and slashing prices further still. That caused an historic collapse in oil prices -- exactly the opposite of what was needed to stabilize the shaken market.   Ordinarily, lower energy prices would be great news for American drivers, airlines and other energy consumers.   The average price for a gallon of gasoline has plunged to $2.01, according to AAA. That's down from $2.44 a gallon just a month ago. Several US states, including Texas, Ohio and Michigan, are now seeing prices at the pump below $1.75 a gallon.  Yet many Americans can't take advantage of cheap gas prices because of the severe travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Most people are working from home, and few are taking road trips.   Likewise, airlines -- whose profits generally increase when oil is cheaper -- have canceled thousands of flights, and some like EasyJet in Europe have grounded flights altogether.  Trump to the rescue? The oil crash has left Trump in an awkward spot.  On one hand, he's long been in favor of cheap energy prices for consumers, and Trump has never been shy about bashing OPEC for not pumping more. Yet the oil crash, combined with excess production, threatens to bankrupt US shale oil companies and wipe out tens of thousands of oil jobs -- many in Republican-leaning states. That's why Trump has said he might eventually get in the middle of the oil dispute between the two nations.  In fact, Trump said Monday on a call to Fox News that he planned to raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  ""Right after this call, I'm speaking to a gentleman named Vladimir Putin,"" Trump said, adding that both Russia and Saudi Arabia ""went crazy"" about oil. A readout of the call from the Kremlin said the two presidents agreed to hold talks on the state of the oil market at the ministerial level.   Resolving the oil war can't stop the crash, however.  ""Now the question is: Can the US and OPEC save this market? The demand shock has become so large that they can't do it alone,"" Currie, the Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote.   He added that even a global production cut -- an outcome that ""appears impossible at this point"" -- would be ""too late to stop the current surplus.""  Only the end of the coronavirus crisis can stop that. ",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/tech/xbox-series-x-specs/index.html,Microsoft reveals details about its next-generation console Xbox Series X ,"The Series X will be capable of running 4K graphics at 60 to 120 frames per second, meaning that game graphics should display clear details and games will appear smooth even during action-packed scenes. The new console is also getting an upgraded graphics card and processor so it could run more graphic-intense games. Notably, high-end PCs are capable of running graphic-intense games at as much as 200+ frames per second, so this upgrade for Xbox brings its technical specs closer to what's already available on the market for PC gamers. Consoles have lagged behind PCs when it comes to providing higher resolution in gaming, but are often more affordable and easier to set up than computers. Like its predecessor, the Xbox One X, the new console has one terabyte of storage, but it has been upgraded for faster load times.  ""Modern devices have changed our expectations on how quickly you can move between experiences or applications,"" Xbox's senior communications manager Will Tuttle wrote in a blog post. ""Most of us want to be able to instantly jump into an experience or return right to where we left off."" With the upgrade, Xbox is claiming it will be possible to play a game to a certain point, turn off the console and perform a system update, and still get back to where you left off. Games with immersive open worlds like ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" ""Final Fantasy XV"" and ""Assassin's Creed Odyssey"" could benefit from the faster load times, Xbox said. Tuttle wrote that Xbox has been working with TV manufacturers for the past two years to make sure displays are ready to support the Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also touting the new console's ability to support older games.  ""As gamers themselves, [the team] understood that we all have our favorite memories, franchises or titles that we want to continue to play even as technology and game design continues to advance,"" Xbox wrote. Since the Xbox Series X has upgraded storage and overall specs compared to the Xbox One X, it's easier to support past games.  ""They gave us the Xbox One X and it was like we got this big playground to play with,"" said Peggy Lo, principal program management lead of backward compatibility, in the blog post. ""Then we got the Xbox Series X and it was like we had a whole amusement park to play in.""",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/tech/solar-windows-ubiquitous-energy-california/index.html,This company wants to turn your windows into solar panels,"Ubiquitous Energy has developed transparent solar cells to create its ClearView Power windows, a kind of ""solar glass"" that can turn sunlight into energy without needing the bluish-grey opaque panels those cells are generally associated with. The company, spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2012, hopes to use that tech to turn practically any everyday glass surface into a solar cell.  ""It can be applied to windows of skyscrapers; it can be applied to glass in automobiles; it can be applied to the glass on your iPhone,"" Miles Barr, Ubiquitous Energy's founder and chief technology officer, told CNN Business.  The company is looking to capitalize on the United States' renewable energy boom, with solar and wind energy projected to surpass coal by 2021, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. While several companies are working on similar products, the technology is still in the relatively early stages. It's one of several emerging products that harness solar energy, with others including irrigation pumps and a ""solar oven"" that can be used to make cement and steel. Ubiquitous Energy's home state of California is one of the first to require that every new home incorporate some form of solar technology.  ""This is great for ClearView Power because homeowners can install windows just like they would anyways, but they actually produce power to meet this requirement,"" Barr said. The core of the product is an organic dye that can be used to coat glass surfaces. The dye allows visible sunlight to pass through -- just like normal windows do -- but captures the invisible infrared rays from that sunlight. ""Light absorbing dyes are found all around us. They're in paints, they're in pigments for clothing, and they're even in electronic devices,"" Barr said. ""What we've done is we've engineered those dyes to selectively absorb infrared light and also convert that light into electricity."" That does mean some of the energy is lost. ""Their basic drawback is their relatively low efficiency,"" said Anne Grete Hestnes, a professor of architecture at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology who specializes in solar energy. ""However, it is all a question of price. If the transparent cells are cheaper, and if the cells are to cover a relatively large area ... it may be the better solution,"" she added. Barr said Ubiquitous Energy's transparent panels can produce up to two-thirds of the energy that traditional panels do. And he said they cost about 20% more to install than a regular window, a cost he claims is offset by the electricity they generate. The company wants its solar windows to complement traditional rooftop panels rather than replace them. The combination of both methods, according to Barr, could bring the net energy consumption of large buildings to zero — meaning they produce as much electricity as they consume.  Ubiquitous Energy has started installing its solar windows on buildings, including at its headquarters in Redwood City where it manufactures the glass panels.  ""We are already installing and selling ClearView Power windows in limited sizes, and we're in the planning phase for a facility that we'll be able to produce windows at any size,"" Barr said.  However, the coronavirus outbreak has forced much of the company's production planning to be done remotely. But Barr said it is still making ""significant progress.""  ""It's still a bit early to tell what the full effects of the global pandemic will be, including for our business,"" said Barr, adding that he is ""still optimistic we'll be able to begin manufacturing activities in the next two years."" By that point, he anticipates Ubiquitous Energy will be closer to justifying its name: ""We really see the future of this technology as being applied everywhere, all around us, ubiquitous.""",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/business/ford-ge-healthcare-ventilators/index.html,"Ford to build 50,000 ventilators in 100 days","The automaker said it will make the ventilators at its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The factory will be staffed by 500 United Auto Workers union members who have volunteered to work on the project, Ford said. The ventilator is currently being made by Florida-based Airon Corp. and has been licensed by GE Healthcare. Ford (F) has been working with GE Healthcare to help it increase its ventilator output.  The Airon Model A-E ventilator that Ford will produce operates on air pressure alone and requires no electricity. Airon currently makes three of the ventilators per day at its factory in Melbourne, Florida. Ford's plant will produce the ventilators around the clock with three shifts of workers, Ford said, and it will make 7,200 of the devices per week. Ford is also working with GE Healthcare to increase GE's own production of its more advanced ventilators. It's also working on designing a simplified GE Healthcare ventilator device that Ford could also produce.  Other automakers have also vowed to help manufacture ventilators on a large scale. General Motors (GM) is partnering with another ventilator maker, Ventec Life Systems, to help increase Ventec's production. Tesla  (TXLZF)CEO Elon Musk said he plans to manufacture ventilators at a Tesla plant in Buffalo, though the company has not shared details about that effort. A few other companies, including Dyson in the United Kingdom, are also designing new ventilators and pledging to help traditional medical supply manufacturers ramp up their production. On Monday, Virgin Orbit announced it was also seeking to produce ventilators, making it one of the first aerospace companies to get involved. The California-based rocket startup said it has been working with UCI Health, a California research hospital, and the University of Texas at Austin, to create a prototype for a so-called ""bridge"" ventilator — a  simple device that the company says can be quickly manufactured on a large scale.  Bridge ventilators could be used to treat some of the less critically ill Covid-19 patients in order to free up more sophisticated ventilators for those in dire need, Virgin Orbit said. Kevin Zagorski, an engineer who typically works on rocket engine design, is heading up Virgin Orbit's ventilator manufacturing efforts. He said that if the bridge ventilator design gets FDA approval for its design in the coming days, Virgin Orbit could begin producing thousands of the ventilators a week at its Los Angeles factory.",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/opinions/covid-19-economy-freelancers-struggling-bodenheimer/index.html,Shutdown is a body blow for freelancers,"  This extension is incredibly important because, according to the Freelancers Union, full-time freelancers made up 28% of the American workforce in 2019; in 2014, they made up just 17%. Nonetheless, there are already signs that the implementation of unemployment benefits for self-employed people will be riddled with problems and inconsistencies.   Last week, the president of the Freelancers Union, Rafael Espinal, sent a letter to New York City and state lawmakers, urging them to consider the specific plight of freelancers. He wrote, ""Unlike traditional employees, freelancers are excluded from receiving paid leave and unemployment insurance, and shoulder the cost of their own health and disability insurance. Without a concerted effort to extend relief to these workers, the economic impact of COVID-19 on independent workers will be nothing less than devastating.""   It's important to note that the freelancers who will be the hardest hit tend to be younger and female. First, younger generations are freelancing at much higher rates than their parents: a whopping 53% of Gen Z are freelancers, according to a 2019 report from the Freelancers Union and Upwork. Second, although (according to the Freelancers Union report) 59% of freelancers are men, women are less likely to be high-earning freelancers:  nearly half make less than $25,000/year, compared to just 34% of men. In addition, women's reasons for freelancing are often related to child care or elder care responsibilities.   Fortunately, this new stimulus package is vastly more inclusive and equitable in terms of addressing the scope of the Covid-19-related economic crisis than the Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed earlier this month. The latter provided no direct aid to self-employed freelancers and gig workers, who make up almost a third of the American workforce. The only thing it promised was eventual help in the form of tax credits equal to what freelancers would have been paid during the affected period.   While tax credits help some freelancers -- especially those highly paid ones who tend to take a hit when it's time to pay taxes -- they are essentially too little, too late for many of us. According to the ""Freelancing in America"" report, the median hourly rate among freelancers overall is $20/hour (gross annual salary of $41,600), while for skilled freelancers, it's $28/hour ($58,240/year). In other words, most freelancers don't have much in the way of a ""rainy day fund."" In addition, many freelancers file their taxes annually rather than quarterly, which means that they wouldn't see the aid from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act until spring 2021.   Thus, many freelancers are breathing a sigh of relief that they too will be included in the new stimulus package. As Espinal told me by phone, ""This is going to hopefully ensure that there's cash flow into the homes of freelancers,"" who, he stressed, are doubly affected by this crisis because we depend on many of the non-essential small businesses that have been shut down in order to do our work.   Espinal also noted that Pandemic Unemployment Assistance wouldn't have been achieved if not for the committed negotiating of Democratic senators, which resulted in a delay in an agreement by a few days, but ultimately a better deal. Espinal was in close contact with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer's office to make sure freelancers were included in the language of the package.   In a tone-deaf move devoid of empathy for what Americans are going through, some GOP senators objected to the extra unemployment benefits that would be offered to eligible workers, $600 per week, feeling that it was ""too generous"" (as Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii tweeted) and might disincentivize people to go back to work once the crisis is over. This of course ignores the fact that the extra unemployment benefits only last for four months and wouldn't be indefinite. And, just before the House passed the stimulus bill Friday, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, attempted to thwart its passage by requesting a full roll-call vote and forcing many members of the House to travel to Washington (despite the fact that this is ill-advised and risky during a pandemic) to block him.   It's never been clearer which party—in the wake of an unprecedented public health and economic crisis—is committed to helping working people survive.   Still, despite freelancers' inclusion in the stimulus package, for freelancers like me in California, this extension of benefits is coming at a time when many of our careers have already been upended by AB5. This California law mandates the reclassification of certain workers formerly classified as independent contractors so that they're considered waged employees.  But there are many self-employed people who aren't ""gig workers"" who work for one or two rideshare companies. Many of us are freelancers who provide services -- without key employment protections -- for dozens of entities per year, and we don't meet the standard to be reclassified as employees, nor do many freelancers want to be reclassified. According to the National Employment Law Project, the new legislation's unemployment assistance will extend to self-employed people and independent contractors, and even if a state has an inappropriate definition of ""employee,"" gig workers can use this new program -- showing proof of income and an explanation of how the pandemic prevents them from working -- to get the same benefit they would if they qualified for state unemployment insurance. Whether workers can get state unemployment insurance or federally funded pandemic unemployment assistance, according to NELP, they all go through the same state unemployment insurance portal and benefits are calculated the same. It's unclear to some, however, if freelancers do end up qualifying for state benefits, how the amount would be calculated. This CNBC article lays out some details and highlights the complexity of freelancers' situation: ""The [Labor Department] guidance should also stipulate if and how gig workers can get benefits for a severe decline in income, rather than outright job loss. Gig workers and contractors are likely to be able to get partial benefits if they don't earn too much."" Also, as the article notes, many people who apply for unemployment aren't granted the benefits: approval rates range from a shockingly low 10.5% in North Carolina to over 50% in New Jersey.     For those of us with varying incomes from month to month, and who don't have ""anchor clients"" (repeat clients) who have explicitly told us they can no longer contract with us because of Covid-19, it's very difficult to prove that we're losing income because of the pandemic. For example, how does a freelancer writer know if a story they pitched isn't picked up because the outlet doesn't want it, or because they no longer have the budget for it? Also, given that state unemployment agencies are completely overwhelmed by the millions of claims that have been filed recently, the fact that freelancers' situations and sources of income are more complex could cause a delay for many of us in accessing benefits.      As a full-time freelance writer and editor, I can't begin to imagine what the long-term effects of the pandemic for me will be. I know writers who cover travel, food, art and live music are reeling right now—and that an increasing number of media outlets are freezing their freelance budgets or laying off their entire staff. The media industry has been in crisis for years now, and this will only worsen the situation, undoubtedly resulting in more layoffs and, in turn, a more saturated market of freelance writers.      As Espinal stated in a Freelancers Union email press release Friday afternoon, ""This bill is an incredible victory for the millions of freelancers who are unable to work due to this crisis."" He also called on state and local governments to enact their own relief packages to help freelancers. However, even with this important win, direct economic assistance still feels very theoretical for the millions of freelancers scrambling to figure out how to apply for unemployment benefits or even, like me, how to prove that we qualify. We need state unemployment agencies and the Labor Department to release clear and standardized guidelines, and to be generous in approving our applications.    ",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/economy/shipping-company-workers-coronavirus/index.html,Workers on the front lines risk their health to give America essential goods,"""It's scary,"" said Tony Mazzella, a UPS driver. ""I'm a new Yorker. I typically don't get scared of anything, but you know what? It's essential that I'm here because people rely on their deliveries,"" he said. Tony Mazzella is one of nearly half a million UPS (UPS) workers around the world still on the job. UPS and other shipping companies, including FedEx (FDX), DHL and the United States Postal Service are considered ""critical infrastructure"" by the federal government and therefore do not have to shut down. UPS confirmed some of its employees have tested positive for COVID-19. The company says it follows recommended cleaning and sanitation guidelines before allowing employees to return to work, and it provides ""income and health care security provisions for employees who test positive, or for employees who are required by a physician to quarantine, or for employees who are required to quarantine due to their spouse of family member testing positive,"" said Glenn Zaccara, a UPS spokesperson. With hundreds of thousands of employees, often working in close proximity, UPS says it is adhering by all Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization guidelines. The company has also instituted contactless customer deliveries. ""Do we feel pressure? No, but this is a concern,"" Mazzella said of coming to work each day. ""It's a concern for my coworkers and our families. I don't want to hear that one of my coworkers got sick, or one of my customers.""  Grocery store workers More than 2 million grocery store workers around the country have also been deemed critical. Jessica Camacho is one of them, working as a bookkeeper and cashier at the Morton Williams Supermarkets on the Upper West Side of New York City - the epicenter of coronavirus in the United States.  ""Coming in every day is nerve-wracking, I am definitely afraid of getting this virus,"" said Camacho. ""But I am doing everything I can to protect myself and I am here for the community and I have to be here to support them and continue doing my job every day."" Grocery store employees come into contact with high volumes of people daily, and supermarkets around are now sanitizing stores hourly -- including shopping carts, freezer doors, and even credit card pin pads. They've also created special hours for shoppers over the age of 60, one of the highest risk groups. While Morton Williams was able to secure facemasks for their employees, there weren't enough to go around. So, they decided to make their own. ""The masks have been our biggest issue,"" said Avi Kaner, co-owner of Morton Williams Supermarkets. ""My mother who is a retired seamstress and a senior citizen has been working around the clock, producing masks that we're giving to our employees."" Several employees at Morton Williams Supermarkets have tested positive for COVID-19. Those employees are immediately sent home, the store is sanitized, and they cannot return to work without a doctor's note clearing them of the virus. The supermarket chain, which has 1200 employees is installing plexiglass partitions at their cash registers this week, according to Kaner.  Camacho wears her mask every minute of the day except when she's at home. ""I feel most safe if I have my mask and my gloves on,"" she said. Food delivery workers For those Americans who aren't venturing into grocery stores, on demand food delivery services like FreshDirect are lifelines. The company has 3,000 employees and has seen a 50% increase in demand in the last week. FreshDirect and Morton Williams are both looking to hire more employees to meet the demand. John Dozier has been working for FreshDirect for 12 years and is currently driving grocery deliveries to people's homes six days a week.   ""It feels crazy to understand how much people really need us now in this pandemic,"" said John Dozier. ""It's a little risk coming outside every day to do your job. But I kind of feel like a superhero in a sense, saving the world."" A few employees have tested positive at the FreshDirect facility in the Bronx, where Dozier works, said the company. The company said it notified any employees the sick employee interacted with and deep cleaned the workspace. Signs on the doors of FreshDirect ask employees not to come to work if they feel sick.  ""Our drivers and frankly all of the people that are coming in to make and package the food are really doing their part,"" said David McInerney, CEO of FreshDirect. ""If we are going to make that effort, then everybody else be responsible and stay home if you can."" While millions of Americans continue to show up to work, at least virtually, the virus continues to spreading at a rapid rate, and the United States has now overtaken China as the nation with the most confirmed cases. Self-quarantining for those who can helps keep other Americans on the front lines safe. ""Take all your precautions please,"" Camacho the Morton Williams bookkeeper asks of us. ""Keep us safe so we can keep you safe.""",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/media/facebook-news-journalism-grants-coronavirus/index.html,"Facebook is giving $25 million to news organizations, and spending $75 million more to help","Though readership and viewership is up during the pandemic, many news organizations have seen revenue drop from lost advertisements, events and other money making avenues. Across the world, local news organizations in particular have been hard hit, with some shutting down their print editions, furloughing and even laying off staff.  Facebook (FB) says the $100 million investment is in addition to $1 million in grants for local news outlets and $2 million in grants to fact checking efforts, both of which it had previously announced.  ""Many news organizations are intensely struggling because of the economic fallout from the outbreak,"" Campbell Brown, Facebook's head of global news partnerships, said in an interview with CNN Business. ""Even though news consumption generally is on the rise, and in some cases you're seeing subscriptions go up, that increase isn't enough to make up for the loss that many news organizations are experiencing in ad dollars. We're in this position to help, so we are."" The grant money will be dispersed to hundreds of news outlets through an application process. The money announced on Monday is separate from Facebook's year-ago commitment to invest $300 million in local journalism in three years. Brown said they were ""overwhelmed"" by the number of applications after Facebook initially offered $1 million in grants to news outlets earlier this month. Many of the applicants were ""just trying to keep the lights on,"" Brown said. ""This has just been hitting local news really hard."" The increased marketing outlay will be ""in markets that are really hardest hit"" by the virus around the world, Brown said, as the ad industry slows.   Some of the marketing will take the form of Facebook buying advertising for themselves on television and online. A Facebook spokesperson later told CNN Business they're still working out the details of the marketing effort, but will try to get the money out as quickly as possible though some may hit later this year.  The point, from Brown's perspective, is that the ads will help to replenish the coffers of cash-strapped news outlets who have lost ad revenue as other businesses slow down or completely shutter.  ""This is not a reallocation; this is new money, for marketing specifically to news organizations that are struggling financially during the outbreak,"" she said.",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/success/work-from-home-office-set-up/index.html,It's not too late to set up a decent home office,"More than half the US population has been ordered to stay at home, which means there are a lot of remote-work novices trying to figure out the most efficient and comfortable way to work. For some, that means spending a lot more time in their existing home office, while others are setting up shop at their kitchen table, couch or even using an ironing board as a standup desk. And since there's a good chance we won't be returning to work for a while, it's worth putting a little effort into making your space comfortable and conducive to getting the job done.  Find your space  While any flat surface could work as a desk, you want to look for a space that is somewhat secluded and quiet.  Look for spaces that offer easy access to outlets and good lighting. There's bonus points if it's by a window. ""A window not only for the light, but also fresh air,"" said Kerrie Kelly, an interior designer and chair-elect for the American Society of Interior Designers. ""When we are hunkered down in this way, we don't realize how beneficial that vitamin D and fresh air truly is."" In addition to a window, aim to have two sources of lighting, recommended Stephanie Kennedy, a national retail market manager with Room & Board.  ""Overhead lighting and then a desk lamp to give you more direct light on your surface and keyboard,"" she said. ""It can be straining on your eyes to look at monitors all day, and if you don't have the right light it causes more strain."" Try and keep work materials organized to avoid having work seep everywhere into your home.  ""You don't want to drag work into the living room or other places you are trying to relax in,"" said Kelly.  Get your body right  It doesn't matter if you are sitting at a proper office desk or your makeshift office in the corner of your living room -- how you sit and position your computer is important.  ""If your body is aching at the end of day or hour, it is trying to tell you something,"" said Kristianne Egbert, a certified professional ergonomist. When choosing your work surface, look for one that is close to elbow height when you are seated. If the surface is too high, you can use a folded towel, blanket or pillow to increase your height.  And pay attention to how you sit.  Chair: If possible, sit in a chair over the more tempting couch or bed. Try and keep your thighs parallel to the floor and make sure your feet rest on the floor or some sort of footrest (a box is fine).  Elbows: Try and keep your elbows close to your side with your forearms parallel to the floor, creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and lower arm, Egbert said. Get the right hardware The position of your screen, keyboard and mouse are important.  If you're using a PC, you want the monitor to be about an arm's length away with the top third of the screen at eye level, according to Egbert. Laptop users should safely prop up the device so the screen is at eye level.  If possible, experts suggested using an external keyboard and mouse -- that will allow you to prop up a laptop to eye-level. You want your keyboard in front of you with the mouse next to it so your elbows are below your shoulders and your elbows are around 90 degrees, according to Ellen Kolber, corporate ergonomic consultant and hand therapist Listen to the aches and pains   Your body will give you clues if you need to readjust your home office.  For instance, according to Egbert, if your neck is stiff at the end of the day, that usually signals there's an issue with your screen.  ""You want whatever screen you are looking at directly in front of you, around an arm's reach away and at eye-level,"" she said.  Back pain also means you might need to readjust. If your upper back is sore, Egbert said it could mean your monitor is too far away and you are leaning forward or reaching too much for the keyboard or mouse. ""When you see the hunching position, try and bring your shoulders back in line.""  Lower back aches tend to signal you aren't maintaining the natural lumbar curve in your back. If there's a big gap between your lower back and your chair that's a problem. Egbert suggested rolling up a towel or pillow to fill the space. Add some little things  We're all under a lot of pressure these days, which can make work stressful and make it hard to focus.  Adding a few personal touches can be a mood booster.

CPAP devices have been used in hospitals in China and Italy to treat coronavirus infections, with reports indicating that roughly half of such patients have avoided the need for ventilators, according to the statement. There is a severe shortage of ventilators in many countries, including Britain, that are fighting severe outbreaks.  ""These devices will help to save lives by ensuring that ventilators, a limited resource, are used only for the most severely ill,"" said professor Mervyn Singer, a critical care consultant at University College London Hospitals (UCLH).  CPAP machines help to keep patients' airways open and increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs by pushing air and oxygen into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate. According to the statement, 100 of the newly-designed machines will be used in clinical trials at UCLH, with ""rapid rollout to hospitals around the country ahead of the predicted surge in Covid-19 hospital admissions."" Professor Tim Baker of UCL said a process that can take years had been reduced to a matter of days, explaining that the team had worked ""all hours"" to disassemble and analyze an existing device before using computer simulations to ""create a state-of-the-art version suited to mass production.""  Following clinical trials, Mercedes and other F1 teams could produce up to 1,000 of the devices per day. Some experts have raised concerns that using CPAP machines may put hospital workers at risk by creating a mist of droplets containing the virus. But Britain's National Health Service has recommended the devices be used to treat coronavirus patients, saying the risk of infection is low so long as staff wear personal protective equipment. Andy Cowell, managing director of Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains, said he was proud that the F1 engine maker was able to participate and help deliver the device on the ""fastest possible timeframe."" Lewis Hamilton won his sixth F1 world title in 2019 driving a Mercedes car. The start of this year's season has been postponed at least until June because of the pandemic.  Race to a ventilator Separately, a consortium of businesses including Airbus (EADSF), Ford (F) and BAE Systems (BAESF) and several F1 teams said Monday that it received orders from the British government to produce over 10,000 ventilators. The consortium said it would start production this week, and that it expects to receive prompt regulatory approval following a final audit. F1 teams working on the project include McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull Racing, Renault Sport Racing and Williams. Last week, vacuum cleaner maker Dyson said it had designed a new ventilator to treat coronavirus patients. It plans to make 10,000 of the devices for the UK government and donate 5,000 to the global effort.",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/tech/amazon-workers-walkout-coronavirus/index.html,"Amazon workers to stage a walkout Monday, demanding closure of Staten Island facility","Employees are protesting Amazon's decision to keep the Staten Island warehouse open despite news of a confirmed case of the virus there last week, said Christian Smalls, a process assistant at the facility who is leading the walkout. Many more employees have tested positive for the virus at the facility than the company has publicly acknowledged, Smalls said, claiming that as many as five to seven workers have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement Sunday evening that the company's top priority is the health and safety of its employees. The spokesperson said that Amazon ""recently implemented daily temperature screenings in our operations sites as an additional preventative measure to support the health and safety of our customers and employees."" ""We believe direct communication is the best avenue to discuss feedback, and our teams onsite are speaking directly with employees each day to hear their questions and discuss options that are available in this ever changing environment,"" the spokesperson said. The walkout will begin at 12:30 p.m. and could involve anywhere between 50 and 200 people, Smalls estimated. Following the walkout, the workers will gather at a nearby public bus stop and speak to the press. ""The plan is to cease all operations until the building is closed and sanitized,"" Smalls told CNN in an interview. ""We're not asking for much. We're asking the building to be closed and sanitized, and for us to be paid [during that process]."" Before deciding on the walkout, Smalls, who said he helps his direct supervisor manage 60 to 70 people daily, said that every day for the past week, he has sought the help of the facility's general manager — to no avail. Amazon later told CNN Smalls is not a manager and that he does not manage anyone; Smalls agreed he is not a manager on paper, but disagreed with Amazon's claim that he does not manage other workers. Last Tuesday, Smalls said, he sent a worker home who was visibly ill. Smalls was later put on quarantine himself. Amazon told CNN Smalls is being paid throughout his quarantine. That is consistent with prior Amazon statements that the company will pay workers who must self-isolate due to the virus. Smalls said he was informed on Saturday of his quarantine status, but that he has not yet received payment because his normal pay period does not end until the end of this week. Smalls said he hopes Amazon relents quickly, because facilities like his are ""breeding grounds for this pandemic."" Employees are being advised to continue working until they receive confirmation of a positive test result, Smalls said. But, he said, that may be too late, due to the virus's days-long incubation period. Smalls added that he has attempted to contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office, but has yet to receive a response. On Sunday, Amazon implemented daily temperature checks for everyone entering the Staten Island facility at the beginning of their shifts, according to one worker employed there and an internal post in Amazon's employee app that was viewed by CNN Business. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter on Sunday, Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, said ensuring the safety of the company's US employees was ""our first and primary concern."" ""This is our first and primary concern, which is making sure Amazon employees — 500,000-plus in the United States — are protected as they can be as they go about doing this heroic work for their fellow citizens,"" said Carney. He added: ""We've also told employees if they're uncomfortable coming to work, if they're worried about their own health, they can take unlimited unpaid time off through the end of April with no repercussions at all. We don't want anyone to feel like their job depends on coming to work in this circumstance."" Amazon has previously said that employees who fall ill or who are quarantined will receive two weeks' pay, and that Amazon contractors who test positive for the virus may apply for up to two weeks' pay from a $25 million relief fund the company has established. The company has also said it is taking ""extreme measures to ensure the safety of employees at our site[s]."" That includes regularly sanitizing door handles, elevator buttons, lockers and touch screens, Amazon said, as well as staggering shifts and spreading out chairs in break rooms. In addition, workers are being asked to keep at least six feet from one another during the workday, according to Smalls. But those measures are not enough, said Smalls, who reiterated calls for Amazon to close the Staten Island facility for a deep clean.  -- Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report. -- Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Christian Smalls' title. He is a process assistant. This story has also been updated to report that Smalls has been quarantined and clarifies the number of people he said he helps manage.",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/perspectives/sheila-bair-federal-reserve-small-business/index.html,Sheila Bair: The Fed is making the right moves to help America's small businesses,"When the coronavirus started roiling financial markets earlier this month, the Fed again reverted to its 2008 ""playbook,"" pumping hundreds of billions into the banking system, but with little discernible effect on Main Street. Fortunately, this week, the Fed corrected course. In a bold move, it announced new programs that use its ability to create money to more directly help the real economy, including employers large and small who are struggling to make payroll, and households hit hard by job losses or reduced hours.  Larger employers will benefit from the Fed's decision to start buying the debt of commercial companies, including newly issued debt. Never before has the Fed bought the bonds of private, non-financial companies, confining its past purchases primarily to government-backed debt and mortgage securities. Large companies rely heavily on issuing bonds for their cash needs, and as their revenues evaporate from economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus, they will need to rely on bond issuance even more. Importantly, companies will not have to start making payments on the bonds until six months after issuance. Smaller employers do not rely on bond markets, but rather bank loans for much of their financing needs. However, given economic uncertainties, banks may be reluctant to lend to small businesses because of the risk they might fail. So the Fed will launch a facility to directly support lending to small businesses. We don't yet have the details for this program, but it should provide welcome respite to the many cash-strapped restaurants, retail stores and others that have closed to protect against coronavirus.  These are just two examples of how the Fed is trying to reach farther into the real economy. It will also partner with the US Treasury Department to provide government loans to small businesses and distressed sectors like transportation and hospitality. The Fed will provide the cash, while the Treasury will protect the Fed against any losses on those loans. Finally, the Fed has committed to buying unlimited amounts of US government debt, which will help finance the massive deficits required for the $2 trillion economic stimulus bill being approved by Congress. In this way, the Fed is indirectly helping individual households by providing the financing the US Treasury needs to make the cash payments and expanded unemployment benefits included in that bill.  The Fed's actions — while welcome today — are not without longer-term risks. For instance, if the Fed's unlimited purchases of government debt become the new normal, it would incentivize the government to be even more profligate in managing the nation's finances and risk high inflation. But in the near term, the Fed is making the right move. The economic devastation from coronavirus is likely to lead to a precipitous drop in consumer demand for goods and services, which, if anything, will lead to depressed prices.   While we should all applaud the Fed for launching these new programs, we should also recognize that aggressive monetary policy has made us more susceptible to economic shocks. Again, with the best of intentions, the Fed has kept interest rates near zero for about a decade, encouraging excessive borrowing — particularly in the corporate sector — and inflating asset prices across the board. This has made markets susceptible to extreme volatility and contributed to declines in virtually all asset classes, including stocks, bonds and commodities. It will be important that the Fed promptly withdraw these extraordinary measures when the economy starts to recover to prevent reflating credit bubbles and limit inflation risk. ",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/coconut-water-vita-coco-sales-coronavirus/index.html,The pandemic's newest shortage? Coconut water,"Sales of products from Vita Coco, which makes shelf-stable coconut waters and canned traditional waters, have spiked sharply -- starting two weeks ago on the West Coast. and accelerating nationally during the past few days via e-commerce platforms. ""Sales on Amazon started growing north of 50% [at the beginning of March],"" Michael Kirban, co-founder of Vita Coco and CEO of its parent company All Market, told CNN Business. ""At the same time, really, Costco was telling us: 'We need more product quickly.'"" Vita Coco's coconut water sales soared 200% on Walmart.com compared to the previous year, and sales via Amazon shot up 60% through March 8.  The company's Ever & Ever line of aluminum canned water also spiked 210% after the US Centers for Disease Control issued guidance about Americans preparing for the outbreak. Kirban speculated that consumers may be gravitating toward pantry essentials that have nutritional value and a long shelf life. Bottled and canned water are among the products in high demand in the US as uncertainty swells around the coronavirus outbreak -- even though the US Centers for Disease Control has stated the virus has not been detected in drinking water. ""Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes Covid-19,"" according to the CDC. But the Vita Coco craze is part of a larger trend: Store shelves and online retailers have experienced a drastic run on products such as toilet paper, hand sanitizers, bottled water and even oat milk, despite warnings against panic-buying. Consumers also have been warned about scams touting unfounded cures -- including kale, lemon and coconut water -- for coronavirus, MarketWatch reported.  At All Market, the company ""got comments [from retailers] saying, 'Send us whatever you can,'"" Kirban said.  But that isn't so easy right now. For Kirban's company and others, the sudden surge in demand has created upheaval in product manufacturers' typical courses of business and shocked supply chains in the process.  Typically at this time of year, the Vita Coco warehouses are full of product in preparation for the busy spring and summer seasons. Now those stockpiles are quickly depleting. So, at a time when the company's manufacturers in Southeast Asia and Brazil would be winding down and operating at 60% to 70% capacity, they're running full tilt. ""We still have a good 40 days' inventory on hand for all items,"" Kirban said. ""It happened at a point in time that we're able to keep up."" Vita Coco's supply chain remains intact, at least for now. The fully packaged beverages continue to arrive via ship -- a three-week boat trip from the Asian ports and a nine-day trip from Brazil -- and stored in warehouses in places such as California, Texas, Florida, Washington State and up the Eastern Seaboard. As long as the borders remain open for cargo, the supplies will continue to arrive, Kirban said.  ""There are no coconuts in the US,"" he said. ""If we can't bring in coconut water, [Vita Coco is] in trouble.""  The company is preparing for the possibility of policies changing amid the uncertainty. On Monday, as local communities in the US hunkered down and took drastic measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, Kirban and his team drafted contingency plans if the lockdowns extended to state borders. If that happens, he said, ""there are a lot of states in the middle of the country we just wouldn't be able to get product to."" That potential scenario underscores the strangeness of this business boon for VIta Coco and Kirban. ""We're dealing with these massive spikes in business,"" he said. ""Yet the world is falling apart.""",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/economy/china-economy-stimulus-coronavirus/index.html,China's economy may not grow at all in 2020. That hasn't happened in 44 years,"GDP growth this year in the world's second biggest economy could sink to just 1% or 2%, down from 6.1% in 2019, according to recent estimates by analysts, including a Chinese government economist. In a worst case scenario, the $14 trillion economy may not grow at all, the World Bank warned earlier this week. That would be its weakest performance in 44 years, worse even than the troughs hit during the 2008-2009 global recession and in 1990, when the West imposed sanctions on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Analysts from UBS and Goldman Sachs recently slashed their estimates for China's growth this year to 1.5% and 3% respectively.  Even Chinese officials, who have set annual GDP targets every year since 1985, are wary of making predictions. A policymaker at the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said this week that the government should not set a target for 2020. ""It's difficult to even realize growth of between 4% and 5%. Many have predicted growth to fall to just 1% or 2% [this year]. These circumstances are all possible,"" Ma Jun, a member of the monetary policy committee at the Chinese central bank told the state-owned Economic Daily. Given the huge uncertainties in the outlook, China is finding it hard to determine how much fiscal and monetary stimulus to unleash, Ma said. An ""unrealistic"" growth target may encourage local governments to splurge on infrastructure investments, which do little to ease unemployment or improve people's livelihoods in the short term, he added.  More help needed Still, an official survey this week showing an anemic recovery in China's vast manufacturing industry last month, following a collapse in activity in February, was followed by news of more stimulus measures. China's cabinet on Tuesday announced more than 3 trillion yuan ($423 billion) in extra financial support for small businesses.  The PBOC will provide an additional 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) to small and medium-sized banks, and cut the amount of cash they must hold as reserves. Both measures are aimed at boosting lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Previously, the central bank had injected liquidity or allocated additional lending worth more than 1.65 trillion yuan ($232 billion). The government had also allocated at least 116.9 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in financial relief and stimulus aimed at fighting the virus. Tuesday's announcement included a promise from the government to double ""temporary cash handouts"" to low-income families and the unemployed from March to June. The government didn't specify how much it would give out, but said the move is estimated to benefit more than 67 million people. ""We believe ramping up financial relief for enterprises (especially SMEs) and households inflicted by the pandemic should be the best economic and social policies at the moment,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist for Nomura, said in a note on Wednesday. Beijing is also trying to revive the automotive industry after sales plunged 42% in January and February. The government will extend subsidies and tax breaks on electric vehicles by two years, while cutting sales tax on used cars from May through the end of 2023.  A private survey published Wednesday showed that China's manufacturing activity expanded ever so slightly in March, as factories reopened following the easing of widespread shutdowns and travel restrictions. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.1 last month from a record low of 40.3 in February. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction.  The PMI data suggest the contraction in activity has bottomed out, but the economy has not recovered yet, analysts for Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday. ""The [Caixin] survey suggests that just over half of firms saw conditions improve last month — implying that activity improved marginally relative to February's dismal showing but remains very weak,"" they wrote. ""The slow pace of improvement implied by last month's PMIs is consistent with our view that China faces a drawn out recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak,"" they said. Tens of millions of jobs at risk Capital Economics has one of the most bearish forecasts for China's economy this year. It estimates GDP shrank by as much as 16% in the first quarter, and predicts a contraction of 3% for 2020 as a whole.  China faces two major headwinds as it tries to get back on its feet — weakening foreign demand due to the global pandemic and a potential second wave of coronavirus cases.  Nomura estimates China's economy will grow by only 1% in 2020, causing millions of job losses.  ""We estimate that slumping exports alone could lead to a loss of 18 million jobs in [the second quarter],"" Lu wrote on Tuesday. Caixin will publish its survey of activity in China's services industry — which accounts for roughly 60% of GDP — on Friday. Whatever it shows, analysts expect the government will have to provide more help for the economy.   Tao Wang, chief China economist for UBS, said Beijing is likely to announce more support for individuals, the labor market and health care systems, more infrastructure investment, and additional cuts in interest rates.  ""Moreover, we expect the government to either lower this year's GDP growth target significantly or ... [focus it] instead on coronavirus control, work resumption, poverty reduction and supporting labour market,"" she said.",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/grocery-delivery-coronavirus-police-sheriffs-office/index.html,"In rural America, cops are delivering groceries to vulnerable residents","""These people don't need to get out. They're in a vulnerable age group,"" the 10-year veteran of the department thought. So he posted on Facebook that he'd volunteer to deliver to elderly residents, shoppers with disabilities and veterans. His rural county, located five miles east of the Missouri border, has about 14,000 residents. The calls to Reed quickly came in quickly from residents who had to stay inside because of the coronavirus concerns or because they couldn't find an open slot for pickup at Walmart (WMT). The Walmart in the Fort Scott, Kansas, area doesn't deliver. Neither does the local grocery store. ""There's nobody else here local to do it. We're a rural community and we don't have Uber, Lyft,"" he said.  Reed now visits shoppers' homes with a mask and gloves. He takes their shopping list and cash and heads out to the store in his squad car. He also picks up their prescriptions from Walgreens (WBA).  In the first week, he made almost 40 deliveries. Other deputies at the department are also helping out. ""It's really taken off,"" he said. ""It's very rewarding. It's very humbling."" For residents in the area like Cheryl O'Brien, 56, who has heart and lung illnesses and had a pacemaker put in last year, Reed is her ""lifeline."" ""I was a little perplexed on how I was going to get everything I needed,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to have to put a mask on and risk catching something until I was told about this service."" O'Brien has been using Reed to pick up her medication. ""I felt bad because he has gone so many times,"" she said. ""Somehow, someway, I'm going to try to repay him when this is all over. It's something that I'm never going to forget. I just pray to God they stay safe."" The Bourbon County Sheriff's Office in Kansas is not the only rural law enforcement agency that has taken on the unlikely role of grocery delivery service during this pandemic. Reed got two calls from other sheriffs departments in Kansas that wanted to start similar services for elderly residents in their communities. It's also happening in Nebraska, Tennessee, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, New Jersey and other states. In Appomattox County, Virginia, school resource officers are delivering groceries to elderly residents. Many small and family-owned grocery stores in rural areas have closed in recent years, making access to fresh food difficult. In rural Kansas, more than 100 grocery stores have closed since 2008, and in 50% of those communities a new store has not re-opened, according to the Center for Engagement and Community Development at Kansas State University. Small, rural grocery stores do not always offer delivery, said Rial Carver, project manager with the program. Delivery is labor intensive and ""some of these rural grocery stores operate with a very limited staff."" So during the coronavirus crisis, cops are stepping up to fill the void. Some have more time on their hands right now to make deliveries. ""With schools closing down, with courts closing down, our guys were going to have a lot of free time. So we wanted to do something that would help,"" Matthew Henderson, a spokesperson for the Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana, told a local television station.  In Sarpy County, Nebraska, sheriff's deputies took on the role because scammers had been offering to pick up groceries and supplies for residents and taking their money. ""The idea behind it was to help defeat the scammers who had already started, and to allow those who should be quarantined to stay that way,"" Sgt. Kris Yount told NPR's Nebraska station.",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/facebook-community-help-coronavirus/index.html,Facebook feature lets neighbors volunteer to help each other during pandemic,"On Tuesday, the social network announced the ""Community Help"" feature, where people can volunteer to pick up groceries, ask someone to run an errand or donate to fundraisers. Users in the US will be able to see posts within a 50-mile radius of their location or closer. Facebook said it noticed users offering or asking for help and wanted to build a feature to make the process easier.  It's a concept similar to what's already occurring on Nextdoor, a social network for local communities and neighborhoods. Nextdoor users are using the platform to share local coronavirus updates, pick up medical supplies for others and trade goods like toilet paper and hand sanitizer.  Facebook has been known to borrow features from rivals, including disappearing posts and a dating tool. Fidji Simo, head of the Facebook app, said its user base of over 2 billion people worldwide will give it an advantage over other community services.  ""The likelihood you can find what you need within the Facebook community is high because so many people are currently on Facebook. Our goal is really to maximize the number of people who find the help they need,"" Simo told CNN Business.   The feature will roll out in the US, UK, France, Australia and Canada in the coming days and is expected to become available in more countries in the next few weeks.  The US has more than 160,700 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and there are more than 787,000 known cases around the world.  To raise awareness about the new tool, Facebook plans to run an ad campaign online and on TV. It's already featuring announcements at the top of the News Feed to direct people to its coronavirus information center, which launched earlier this month with updates and best practices from national and global health organizations.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/short-sellers-market-coronavirus/index.html,How some investors have profited from the stock market's huge losses,"But investors didn't realize that Ackman was about to profit in a big way from the turmoil on Wall Street.  Ackman recently disclosed in a shareholder letter to investors in his Pershing Square Capital Management funds that he made $2.6 billion as stocks fell.  How did Ackman do that? He had hedges designed to generate a profit as the broader market tanked and offset otter losses in the wake of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Those hedges were first disclosed in early March. Ackman is not alone. Several investors have benefited from the big drop on Wall Street this year. Most have done so by short selling stocks or owning ETFs that have been betting against the market. Short sellers typically make money by borrowing a stock and selling it, with the hopes of buying it back later at a lower price.  The difference between the original sale price and the repurchase price is the profit. In other words, if you short sell a stock at $50 and it goes down to $30, you make $20. Two ETFs that use this strategy to bet against the broader market -- the Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 1X Shares ETF (SPDN) and ProShares Short S&P500 ETF (SH) -- are both up more than 13% this year while the S&P 500 itself is down nearly 19%. And two funds that are picking individual stocks to short -- the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE) and AdvisorShares Dorsey Wright Short ETF (DWSH) -- have soared nearly 30% and 55% in 2020 respectively.   Investors are making particularly big short bets on companies that stand to lose the most due to a prolonged slump in economic activity,  With that in mind, hotel chains Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) and global industrial equipment company Caterpillar (CAT) are stocks that have been big targets of short sellers as of late.  This is ""some obvious quarantine related short selling,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics for research firm S3 Partners, in a report late last week.  Still, the gains that investors generate from short selling can quickly evaporate if the broader market or individual stocks that are heavily shorted start to rebound.  Shorts about to get squeezed if the worst is over? That might be what's happening now. Investors may be starting to realize that the vicious March market meltdown may have been too extreme. ""During the fastest selloff in history by some measures, it was not a surprise to see 'the baby thrown out with the bathwater,'"" said UBS Global Wealth Management's deputy Americas chief investment officer Solita Marcelli in a report this week. And when markets start to bounce back, that makes the pain for short sellers even worse. The losses for short sellers increase every time a stock they shorted goes up because they eventually have to buy back the stock they borrowed. Again, lets look at the example of the short seller who borrowed a stock at $50. But instead of the stock going to $30, lets say that it rises to $70. The trader is now looking at a $20 loss. If it goes up even more to $90, that's a $40 loss. And so on.  This creates a phenomenon known as a short squeeze. ""If the market continues to rebound, paying high daily financing expenses and seeing mark-to-market profits dwindle is the main recipe for a short squeeze,"" said S3's Dusaniwsky.  The ProShares Short S&P 500 ETF has plummeted 8% in just the past five days as the broader market has rebounded. Even Ackman seems to think that the worst might now be over for the markets. Ackman wrote in his shareholder letter that Pershing has ""redeployed substantially all of the net proceeds from our hedges"" by adding to positions in companies he already owns -- such as Agilent (A), Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), Hilton, Lowe's (LOW), and Restaurant Brands (QSR).  Ackman said he also bought a new stake in Starbucks (SBUX) after selling the position in January. So it seems that he might have changed his tune a bit. He was scared, but now he's using the money he generated from his bearish bet to take advantage of the low prices in the market.  ""By selling the hedge, we generated $2.6 billion of proceeds, the substantial majority of which we invested in both new and existing investments, which we believe will payoff as markets recover,"" Ackman wrote.",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/apple-dark-sky/index.html,Apple acquires popular weather app Dark Sky,"The acquisition, which Apple (AAPL) confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday, will mean the end of Dark Sky's apps for Google's Android and Wear OS, according to a Dark Sky blog post. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  From its beginning as a Kickstarter campaign in 2011, Dark Sky wowed users by promising predictive forecasts that were accurate down to the minute and based on users' exact locations. By applying artificial intelligence to radar data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Dark Sky could tell you exactly when it was going to rain within the next hour, allowing you to time your walk to the coffee shop or your commute home. By 2015, the company said it was serving 8 million forecasts a day.  As of Tuesday, Dark Sky's Android app has been downloaded more than a million times. But the news that Apple will shut down those apps on July 1 suggests the company intends to make Dark Sky exclusive to its walled garden ecosystem. Google (GOOG)'s platform won't be the only one losing access to Dark Sky. As part of the acquisition, Dark Sky said it will discontinue its application programming interface late next year. That feature allows third-party app developers to access and use Dark Sky's weather data in their own apps. On Tuesday, Dark Sky said it has already stopped taking new signups from developers looking to access Dark Sky's data.  That decision could affect platforms such as the Amazon (AMZN) Echo, where unaffiliated apps like Big Sky have tapped into Dark Sky's weather data to mimic the functionality the company provides on iOS and Android. The looming restrictions on Dark Sky could raise fresh questions about Apple's approach to competition. App makers have criticized the company for its tight control over developers, and antitrust officials have questioned the company on its App Store policies. Apple has long maintained that its approach enhances security on the App Store and that it competes vigorously against market-leading apps in various sectors from music to productivity.  But Apple's decision to limit Dark Sky's API comes at a time of intense scrutiny of tech platforms. Mozilla, the maker of the popular Firefox web browser, argued in 2018 to the Federal Trade Commission that restricting APIs ""could be anti-competitive in intent and effect.""  Apple didn't respond to multiple requests for an explanation as to why it will be terminating support for the Dark Sky API and the Google-affiliated apps. Sally Hubbard, an antitrust expert and tech critic at the Open Markets Institute, said the Dark Sky deal is likely to be small enough to avoid federal reporting requirements by Apple. Hubbard argued that any merger or acquisition by a major tech platform should be reviewed by regulators. (The FTC is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of past and completed tech industry mergers.) ""Given that these tech guys already have so much market power, I think we really need to be vigilant of them cutting off the access for others to be innovators in the marketplace,"" Hubbard said. ""Interoperability should be a standard merger condition whenever any of the main tech platforms acquire companies, if the merger is going to be permitted."" Charlotte Slaiman, an antitrust expert at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said restrictions limiting access to Dark Sky or its API might not be deemed anti-competitive if enough competing weather apps can replicate its most valuable functions. But if Dark Sky is deemed unique, it could raise more questions. ""That type of change is what antitrust looks for,"" she said. ""Something that was offered that is no longer offered.""",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/oil-prices-crash-storage-space/index.html,The world could soon run out of space to store oil. That may plunge prices below zero,"Highways are empty. Planes are grounded. Factories are dark. The unprecedented collapse in oil demand has sent crude crashing to 18-year lows.  Supply, on the other hand, remains largely resilient amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. US producers don't want to be the first to blink by turning off production.   That could mean a supply glut so epic that the world will soon run out of room to store all the unneeded barrels of oil.   ""The market is starting to signal that not only is there no demand for this crude, eventually there could be nowhere for it to go,"" said Jeff Wyll, senior energy analyst at Neuberger Berman.   In other words, storage facilities, refineries, terminals, ships and pipelines eventually could reach capacity -- something that hasn't happened since 1998, according to Goldman Sachs. Distressed pricing in some corners of the oil market shows that investors are starting to price in the risk that might occur soon.  Although headline oil prices such as West Texas Intermediate and Brent are trading north of $20 a barrel, some regional prices have recently plunged into single-digit territory. That is especially true for landlocked grades of crude where access to storage is even trickier.   ""Demand is falling so fast relative to supply that very soon many producers' main issue is not going to be whether they can ensure operating profit but rather if they can find an outlet for their crude,"" analysts at JBC Energy wrote in a report Tuesday.   One storage option: loading all that extra crude onto ships. JBC said about 20% of the global fleet of very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could become floating storage. But even that would not absorb the surplus.  In April, some 6 million barrels per day of ""homeless crude"" might literally have nowhere to go, JBC said, a figure that would rise to 7 million barrels per day in May.  Negative oil prices This oil glut is creating a scenario where some obscure grades of oil already have actually dropped below zero. For instance, a Wyoming crude grade was recently bid at negative 19 cents a barrel, Bloomberg News reported last week.  Shrinking storage capacity means that oil producers in some cases have to pay someone just to take the barrels off their hands.   ""The price is trying to go to a level to force companies to keep the oil in the ground. If it has to go negative to incentivize that behavior, then it will,"" said Neuberger's Wyll.   Brent, the global benchmark, is likely protected from this because it's priced on an island in the North Sea where tank storage is accessible. But other grades of crude are located far from water.   WTI, however, is 500 miles from water. That's why Goldman's Currie said WTI, especially WTI Midland, and Canada's Western Canadian Select ""can go negative.""  Subzero oil prices are certainly bizarre, but there is some limited precedence in the energy market.   Last year, US natural gas prices in West Texas traded in negative territory for more than two weeks because there were not enough pipelines to carry the gas away, Reuters reported.  'Mother of all market surpluses' But even then, negative natural gas prices didn't really discourage production. That's because the West Texas natural gas was largely a byproduct of oil pumped from the Permian Basin. Oil companies were willing to take a loss on the natural gas to get what was then a valuable barrel of oil.    With the collapse in oil prices, oil has lost more than two-thirds of its value since the January peak.   Now, US oil companies are starting to make the painful decision of ""shutting in"" production, albeit reluctantly.   Physical constraints have forced at least 900,000 barrels per day of announced ""shut-ins,"" according to Goldman Sachs, which noted the true number is likely higher and ""growing by the hour.""   Rystad Energy said that the ""mother of all oil market surpluses"" will force large production shut-ins in April and May. Older, less productive oil wells will likely shut down first.   Even the strongest US oil companies say they'll scale back spending and production. Chevron (CVX), for instance, announced plans last week to slash spending by 30% and lowered its output targets in the Permian by 20%.   Eventually, the industry could lose as much as 5 million barrels per day of oil supply capacity, Goldman Sachs said.  Will this set the stage for an oil shock? Of course, the weak demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic won't last forever.  Eventually, airlines will take to the air again and start buying jet fuel.  American drivers will buy more gasoline as they get back to work.  But by that point the oil industry might not be producing as much oil as before because wells shut down. Today's oil glut may suddenly turn into tomorrow's oil scarcity, pushing prices ""far above"" $55 next year, Goldman Sachs commodities head Jeffrey Currie said.  ""This will ultimately create an inflationary oil supply shock of historic proportions,"" Currie wrote.  ",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/houseparty-coronavirus-lockdown-scli-intl/index.html,What is Houseparty and is someone trying to sabotage it? ,"Houseparty, owned by online gaming firm Epic Games, has offered up the huge bounty following an explosion of online rumors that downloading the app led to people's accounts on other services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Spotify (SPOT) being hacked.  The app creators strenuously denied the claims and issued a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, telling followers they were investigating claims hacking rumors ""were spread by a paid commercial smear campaign to harm Houseparty."" An earlier tweet insisted that the claims were false.  ""All Houseparty accounts are safe — the service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn't collect passwords for other sites,"" it said. What is Houseparty? Creators describe the app as ""the synchronous social platform that lets you connect face-to-face with the people you care about most."" As countries around the world implement social distancing measures in a bid to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, apps such as Houseparty have become increasingly popular. According to Apptopia, which tracks the performance of apps, Houseparty is currently the third most downloaded app on the iOS app store in the United States -- behind Zoom and TikTok -- and comes top in the United Kingdom.  Also available on Android, iPadOS (for iPad users) and macOS (for Mac users), the app allows partygoers not only to chat, but also to play games and quizzes.  Last year it was acquired by Epic Games, the creators of the phenomenally successful Fortnite.  How does the app work? Although it has gained massive popularity in recent weeks, Houseparty is not new, having been set up in 2016.  Users are required to submit their name, email address, mobile number and a user name.  The app can then access their ""friends"" either via their contacts or by pairing with Facebook or Snapchat.  Once active, it automatically connects with contacts who also have Houseparty accounts.  Particularly popular with children and young people, it is more than just a video calling app as it allows them to interact by playing games and taking quizzes too, including ""Heads Up,"" a trivia game and a Pictionary-type game called ""Quick Draw."" Up to eight friends can join you in a ""party"" and there is the facility to ""lock"" the party, so that only invited guests can join.  Are there security concerns? Rob Pritchard is the founder of The Cyber Security Expert, a UK-based company which advises companies on technical security issues. He told CNN Business that the reports of hacking he had seen online ""don't make much sense."" ""There's no way that you downloading an app like this on your phone should lead to your Netflix or bank account being hacked,"" he said.   He pointed out that a lot of people are signing up for new services, such as Houseparty and Netflix, in the current climate and that they may be using the same passwords for different apps. ""It's really important that every online service user uses a unique password for every site they use,"" Pritchard added. He added that corporate ""sabotage"" was highly unlikely.",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/media/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-reliable-sources/index.html,Journalists challenge Trump's 'revisionist history' regarding coronavirus response ,"On the afternoon of 9/11, Rudy Giuliani told a shell-shocked country that ""the number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear, ultimately."" Rather than dwelling on what the death toll would be, Rudy said ""the effort now has to be to save as many people as possible."" Those words are still ingrained in my mind, nearly twenty years later. And they apply equally well to this slow-motion attack from an invisible terror. April 2020 will be the cruelest month. President Trump tried to prepare Americans on Tuesday by saying ""hard days"" lie ahead. ""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks,"" he said during a 131-minute WH briefing, the longest of his presidency. ""In the seven years I have covered the White House, that is the most stunning briefing I have ever sat through,"" CNN's Jim Acosta said afterward. ""To have public health officials come in and try to explain to the American people that they need to come to grips with the fact -- or the very strong likelihood -- that we're going to see 100,000 to 200,000 Americans die over the next couple months from the coronavirus."" We have to hold hands as a country even though we can't touch. We have to lift up our health care heroes. And we have to hold our leaders accountable for all that they've done and all that they haven't done. The new narrative Before the briefing, HuffPost's S.V. Date wrote that Trump is pushing ""the biggest lie of his adult life ― a revisionist history in which he did everything correctly, that nobody could have anticipated such an outbreak, and his leadership alone is saving millions of lives."" This push continued on Tuesday evening. Mother Jones editor Clara Jeffrey tweeted: ""White House is now setting the goal posts at 100-200K dead as a good job. That is 2-4 times the US casualty rate in the Vietnam War."" The staggering projections are not new. They've been known for weeks. They've been reported for weeks. They just haven't been publicly accepted and shared by the White House until now. That's why Tuesday's briefing was vital — but it was heart-wrenching to think about all the time that was wasted by POTUS. I'm sure that reporters will keep pointing out the federal government's early failures and problems... But will the news coverage resonate? Or will partisanship win out, even during a pandemic? Top tweets -- Daniel Dale's recap: ""This briefing has featured a dishonest overall narrative -- a Trump effort to cast himself as the leader who stood strong against the faction that downplayed the severity of the virus..."" -- David Roberts' chilling prediction about the GOP and the pro-Trump media: ""They will frame this catastrophe as a success and their base will buy it, even as they are filling up local morgues..."" -- Jay Rosen: ""Anyone who says he now soberly accepts the reality of the pandemic. No. He switched claims. From we're doing a fantastic job, the virus is like 15 people to we're doing a fantastic job, if we did nothing it would be millions dead. Those calling him sober are the marks..."" -- Bill Grueskin: Sean Hannity ""is in Reality Mode tonight. Warning that new cases will sharply rise, young people can get sick, quoting Fauci that 100k+ deaths is entirely possible. Something really did change today...""   ""The U.S. needs to know what went wrong"" There's more and more talk about the need for a 9/11-style bipartisan commission, and more and more concern that the country is too fractured to support one. David Ignatius is out with a new WaPo column about this idea. ""The coronavirus pandemic has some eerie similarities to 9/11,"" he wrote. ""Trump certainly didn't cause the virus, any more than President George W. Bush plotted Osama bin Laden's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. And Trump's NSC laudably tried to ring the alarm. But did the White House 'connect the dots' and take action that could have reduced the coronavirus damage?"" Ignatius said ""the last thing America needs right now is more partisan squabbling. But when we're back on our feet, the country needs to know what went wrong. The challenge, now as in 2001, is to prevent the next attack."" Chris Cuomo's new fight On Tuesday morning CNN anchor Chris Cuomo found out that he tested positive for the virus. He announced the diagnosis just as his brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo began New York state's daily briefing. Chris is feeling fine and working from home while quarantining in his basement. He said on Tuesday night's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" that his biggest concern is for his family. He fears that he might have infected his wife and children. ""That is hurting me way more than anything the virus can do,"" he said. -- Key quote from his opening monologue: ""You will have stories like mine popping up all over you in your life. You probably do already. Why? Because testing is just starting to catch up in pulling back the curtain on what we have known to be true for so long. It is not if. It is not even when. We are IN IT. This is a fight. It is going to get worse. We are going to suffer. And you have to accept it not with fear, but within almost a fanatical sense of passion to fight. Because that's the only way you have ever made it through anything hard in your life and this will be no different."" -- Here's my full story about his announcement, his brother's reaction, and more...",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,Last quarter was brutal for stocks. This one is a wild card,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. The details: The S&P 500 (INX) fell 20% between January and March. It was the worst quarter for the index since the end of 2008, when the S&P 500 fell 22.6%. Since World War II, the index has dropped 20% or more in a quarter just five times, according to Bespoke Investment Group. So, safe to say it was a brutal start to the year. But looking forward, what can investors expect?  History suggests a rebound. Bespoke's team points out that seven out of the eight times the S&P 500 has dropped at least 15% in a quarter since World War II, the index rose the following quarter, with an average gain of 5%. Returning to previous levels takes time, Morgan Stanley strategists told clients on Wednesday. The investment bank noted that global stocks typically take 15 months to recover to prior peaks after hitting bear market lows, while the S&P 500 generally takes 20 months. But because the coronavirus, and efforts to contain it, are totally without modern precedent, these examples only get us so far. See here: President Donald Trump cautioned on Tuesday that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die in the coming weeks. That warning has sent stocks lower on Wednesday.  Markets are reacting to ""a likely increase in the duration and breadth of coronavirus lockdowns in the US and elsewhere, which is pointing to a potentially deeper and longer-term hit to economic activity than was anticipated even a week ago,"" Stephen Innes, a strategist at AxiCorp, said in a note to clients. Companies around the world are halting shareholder payouts Companies typically resist slashing payouts to shareholders at all costs. But the depth of the shock from the novel coronavirus, which has triggered a deep recession and imperiled millions of jobs, has left many firms with no choice. Goldman Sachs estimates that S&P 500 dividends will decline by 25% this year. Citigroup, meanwhile, thinks dividends in Europe — which are typically more generous than in the United States — could be sliced in half. Why it matters: The cuts are a sign of just how big a hit the coronavirus has been for global businesses that delivered a record $1.4 trillion in dividends last year. And it could cause further pain for asset managers such as pension funds, which rely on income from dividend stocks to fund payouts to retirees. Pressure to slice dividends is coming from many sources: In the United States, companies that accept federal bailouts or loans to survive the coronavirus crisis are barred from paying dividends to investors in the near term, while regulators around the world are calling on banks to preserve capital so they can keep lending to businesses. The latest: UK banks including HSBC (HBCYF), Standard Chartered (SCBFF) and Lloyds (LLDTF) have halted dividend payments following a request from the country's financial services regulator. The FTSE 100 is off 3.7% on Wednesday as a result. For distressed firms in the retail, hospitality and energy sectors — which have seen revenue dry up — it's about holding onto enough cash to tide them over until restrictions lift and the economy can start to recover. ""It's all about the balance sheet right now,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, told me. America's food supply is at risk Farmers have very little flexibility. They're on a strict planting and harvesting schedule and cannot ramp up or decrease production at will. That puts America's food supply at risk as the coronavirus crisis deepens, my CNN Business colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner reports. April and May are critical planting and harvesting times for many US farmers. They need skilled laborers to work their fields, and a reliable supply chain to deliver their goods. And they don't have any time to waste. If farmers can't find enough workers or if their farming practices are disrupted because of the pandemic, Americans could have less or pricier food this summer. And because farmers around the world face similar problems, the United States could receive fewer food imports, potentially limiting supply and driving up prices. Prices of some items are already higher due to stockpiling.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/carnival-cruise-debt-coronavirus/index.html,Carnival seeks $6 billion as Covid-19 pandemic devastates cruise industry,"The cruise operator announced on Tuesday that it intends to raise $3 billion of secured notes and $1.75 billion of convertible notes — both due in three years — as well as $1.25 billion of new shares.  Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a note on Tuesday that Carnival is suffering ""a monthly cash burn of approximately $500 million"" and the fresh injection of cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months.  Shares in Carnival (CCL) fell 2% in after-hours trading. The stock is down 74% for the year.  Carnival is the world's largest cruise operator. It runs flagship line Carnival Cruise, Costa Cruises, the Holland America Line and the Princess Cruises brand, whose fleet includes the Diamond Princess — a ship that became a floating quarantine zone off the coast of Yokohama in February. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom died. The Zaandam, a cruise ship operated by Holland America, is currently stuck at sea and looking for a port, after eight people tested positive for the novel coronavirus and about 200 people have influenza-like symptoms. Four older guests on board Zaandam have passed away, but Holland America has not provided the cause of death. Other Covid-19 cases have occurred on board ships operated by Costa Cruises. The series of outbreaks, along with the unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and social interaction, aimed at containing the pandemic, have been catastrophic for the cruise industry. Last month, more than 50 cruise lines suspended operations to and from US ports for 30 days due to the ""unprecedented situation"" of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a cruise line trade association. Hardiman, of Wedbush, said in a note last week that it is unlikely the industry will resume operations after the 30 days are up. Even once the pandemic subsides and people who have been hunkering down for months begin to travel and book vacations again, Hardiman warned that very few will look to set sail for the open seas.   ""Cruise travel is likely to be dead last on their lists in terms of both risk and necessity,"" he wrote. ",4/1/2020

Even with the nationwide adoption of stringent mitigation efforts, between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die in the coming weeks, the White House warned on Tuesday. Lawmakers have already approved three rescue packages, but Trump suggested another $2 trillion in spending on infrastructure could be needed to help support the economy.  In Asia, new data revealed the level of damage done to factories in March in countries including South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Analysts at Capital Economics said that output has plunged to levels not seen since 2009, and warned that ""things are likely to get a lot worse in the months ahead."" A private survey meanwhile suggested that manufacturing activity in China expanded slightly in March after crashing the previous month. Economists said the data indicate the country's huge factory sector is stabilizing, but still operating well below its usual capacity.  Steps taken by governments and regulators continue to have consequences for stocks.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/one-block-small-businesses-los-angeles/index.html,One block in America. Six businesses on the brink of disaster,"Behind those numbers are the actual people who own and work at the small businesses. It's impossible to tell all of their stories, but we can tell some. So last week we talked to the owners of six small businesses on a block of Colorado Boulevard in Los Angeles about their hopes and fears right now. The block and its businesses are very much unique, made up of a group of independently-owned stores in the heart of a gentrifying community in eastern Los Angeles. But you could transplant them anywhere in the country -- any town, any large city -- and the stories would be much the same.  Most of the business owners on the block are women, and many are minorities, reflecting a growing trend in the US. They went into what they do with a leap of faith — and a lot of financial risk. Now they're on the brink of ruin. Money may be coming from Washington in the next few weeks; they may not make it that long.  Below are their stories, as they told them. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.  Valerie Brown, owner, Eagle Rock Community Acupuncture. Open since 2009.  ""I wanted to find a place where I could foresee there being foot traffic, Colorado Boulevard is great. I signed the lease in 2008. Both these financial times were and are gloomy, that's for sure. I didn't have as much at stake back then. I was moving into a situation where I thought, 'Oh, things are going to be getting better.' Now I'm in a situation where things were fine and now they're getting worse. I'm very attached to my community. When I go into Trader Joe's I know people. This business has been around for so long, we remember each other. I miss the connection. I feel for all of us shopkeepers.  If I know that we're going to be back in business up and running by May, I think I have enough to get by. If it takes until June, I still think I could do it, but I'd be awfully nervous. If it doesn't look like we can go back by June, I think I'm going to have to cease this business model because it's just not going to be viable. I sure hope that that's not the situation. I hope that at some point this year, we'll all be back to eating in restaurants, going to movies, getting community acupuncture. It would be heartbreaking because of all the connections I've made. And, you know, the patients mean a lot to me, and the community means a lot to me.  I do hope that California will find a way to be lenient with the small businesses and perhaps give us back some of the money that we've pre-paid in order to be in business in the year 2020. We'd need abatement on the rent. To have to pay rent, when we can't work, we'd be drowning in a lot of debt. So far from what I've heard, [the stimulus packages are] probably going to benefit big industries most. Probably hotels, airlines, things like that. Something funny I heard recently was, [what if] if the small business owners received the stimulus and Wall Street had to set up a GoFundMe account instead of it being always in reverse. I'm just not optimistic that something that would help small businesses and not give big handouts to the people who don't need it."" Samara Caughey, owner, Purple Twig, a children's art studio. Open since 2009.  ""It's always a financial risk, always a leap of faith to own your own small business. I started very small. I rented a storefront, did the minimum to get the space ready, and opened up. I hoped parents would drop their kids off to make art, and they did! Then it grew from there.  When I moved there, it was me and Peek-a-boo, a children's indoor play place. In the last 10 years, Colorado Boulevard has grown into a place that the community desires. A lot of the businesses are owned by women. The community has been welcoming. They all have an identity — each storefront. All have a passion, all believe in what they're doing.  This situation is very overwhelming, that's the best word I can use to describe it. We're all going through it. I don't feel like, 'oh poor me.' I'm trying to focus on creative thinking! I'm offering subscriptions for children age 5 to adults. Seems more important than ever to express yourself. I am also fortunate that much of my income comes from summer camp. As long as they register, I have income. If this goes on through summer, I will have to close. That would be such a shame. We are so important to this community in making it vital. If we have to shut down, so many would be affected.  I can hold on until the end of May. Hopefully we get a handle on this situation by then. A loan will not do anything for me or most of the shops on this street. Unless we can get grant funding, that's what we need. Leave the large businesses to get the loans. It becomes more and more apparent we're on a welfare system for the rich where we give millions to the large businesses. They can afford the loans. We can't.""  Jen Yates and Alex Hartunian, owners, Studio Metamorphosis, a fitness center. Open in this location since 2017. Alex: Any small business can owner can relate. It is not easy. Jen: We just put everything together and ... I mean scrounged every single dollar, every penny to open, and we did it. Alex did all of the construction there. He literally poured in blood, sweat and tears, with his own hands. Alex: It was really abrupt. We saw the world changing around us. And I was terrified. It was scary and Jen was equally scared. And we were just like, 'How are we going to survive... we're gonna wake up the next morning and have zero income. Like, how does that work?' Jen: When you put everything into watching something grow, and then it stops suddenly, it's so painful. I was sitting on the floor, just sobbing. Seeing it empty on a day where it should have been full was just heartbreaking to me. This has been my dream, opening up a studio. It was everything, our whole lives, and it's just gut wrenching.  Alex: Yeah, we're scared.  Jen: Yeah, I mean, I think each day, we look at each other and [think], 'How are we going to make this work, how are we going to stay afloat?' But yeah, we're scared like everybody else in the world, because the uncertainty is the scariest part of it. Alex: If we have like hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt in three, four months, what's the point? How will we open? Will people be ready to jump right back into business? Will people still be scared? And the more time goes on, the more the financial equation becomes looming in terms of like, a huge, huge problem. ... [Debt] forgiveness is going to be probably the number one thing that's going to put people at ease and make them comply with the stay at home order. People are scared so they're doing side work. People are getting out there and maybe perpetuating this virus. People want to know that if they hang tight [that] the government [will] tell us, 'Nothing's going to happen to your credit, you're not going to lose your home, you're not going to lose your place of business, and everybody just needs to be in this together.' That's the message out there, but we need to hear that from our government. Jen: We have to take care of our staff. I mean, we're not producing income, and they're not getting paid. And it's heartbreaking because they're starting their families and some of them are getting married now and they're beginning to start a whole new chapter in their lives, and they're so scared about what all this means for them. ... Alex and I will continue to fight and do whatever we can to generate some income to stay afloat. When challenges are presented I don't back away, and I'm going to keep moving forward and fight for it. Laura Porter, owner, Bloom School of Music and Dance. Open since 2008.

Both of us have been musicians and educators for decades, and we were being sent all the kids who wanted to quit. We decided we wanted to teach music education differently. I want to build a school with teachers who have like minds, who treat every student completely individually. Let's feel and express the beat in different ways, hear the rhythmic echoes and play games and feel that joy before we tell them to sit still and listen to the adults. It's really brought all of us together and sharing. Sharing ideas, trying to figure out a better way to do something, and really feeling like we're in it together. It's not showing up between three and eight to do your thing and then you're going home. You know, everybody in the whole school is thinking about this 24-7. We're kind of approaching our business in a lot of ways like educators — How can we do this better? How can we make it more engaging? How can we bring more joy? Like most of the schools across the country, everyone's on Zoom, [somehow,] doing live streaming, to keep things going. So far, we're holding strong. It's not April 1st yet so that's when payments are due. But right now we're holding strong. It's so frightening because it's a day-by-day thing. You know, I can't even look at September because there's no history in our lifetime for this, right? For anyone, it's not just the businesses, it's all the people that have supported those businesses over the years.  [Elected officials] have to listen to the average American out of work. They always talk about how important it is for everybody to spend. If they're out of work, they can't spend. They have to put themselves in other people's shoes and small businesses are a big part of that. [If] they help small businesses, it can help the people that work for them."" Michelle Helseth, owner, Native Boutique, a clothing store. Open in this location since 2014.  ""I bought my house here when my daughter was three, so 19 years ago. I always wanted to open up a shop in our neighborhood. I think this block, this is the heart of the neighborhood. You could do everything from buying wine to cheese to having breakfast and lunch. Going shopping, buying a gift, to having your kids get educated with arts and music and dance or just going to having a children's birthday party next door. We just have everything on this block, all independently owned, all individual owners, majority women-owned. The whole world is trying to process this new reality. It's so fictional. This is something we would see in a movie theater but it's happening. As far as business, it's just come to a screeching halt. And then workman comp's insurance tried to draw from my account. I have no staff, what's the point? So I have to call my workman's comp and say, 'You know I have no staff right now so there's no reason for you to deduct my account.' I just invested in all this inventory. And so I'm extended, expecting for sales pick up in March and April, to get us back where we needed to be. I wish I was able to have reserves. We just don't. We're a small business where I'm a single mom. It's not like I have a husband bringing another income or, or a partner, I don't. This is my everything here. I'm concerned about going deeper into a hole, more debt. We need financial support to help us get through this from our government. We need grants, not just loans. You know, if they're going to give us loans, [it should be] zero interest loans.  Our businesses are the frontline of keeping our neighborhood safe. If we're not here, creating a pleasant, happy, beautiful environment for community for shoppers, for families, for residents ... How safe will the community be when you're having blight on your main shopping boulevard?"" Michelle Wilton, chef/owner of Four Café. Open since 2010. ""I definitely cycle through every emotion. I get angry, I get sad. I think what makes me the saddest is just our employees. I have this overarching sense of responsibility for their lives as well and to provide for them. So, that has been really hard for me trying to just navigate. I need to pay them, they have children. We just haven't generated enough sales to even cover the labor on some nights so myself and our other business partner ... have been working. He's been working in the front of the house and I've been doing all the cooking. We're just really waiting to see what the stimulus is, because if the stimulus comes out and says that they're going to help pay for our staff, then we want to get everybody scheduled immediately just to give them hours, of course. But right now the reality of it is if we don't make the sales we can't pay for the labor. We just added a whole grocery section of online ordering where people can buy toilet paper, they can buy a dozen organic eggs, organic milk, any of our cookie dough, or organic bread... they can pull up curbside and pop their trunk and we put it in and it's a complete, no-contact way of shopping. I put sourdough bread kits on our site, we started pizza kits, hopefully it will generate more business so that we can employ more staff. I had to reinvent the whole thing. Anything I can to help generate business and help employ our staff, that's my number one thing, we have staff that have kids and I just get so worried about them. I have two small children, a four-year-old and an eight-year-old, and it has been tricky trying to succeed at all things. Because now I'm a homeschooling mom, so I do that in the morning and then I go to work ... and I'll go and bake or prepare. My husband will take over with the kids behind me, but we haven't taken them out. My son has asthma so it is a little scary."" -- CNN's Kimberly Berryman contributed reporting. ",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/success/work-from-home-spouse-tips/index.html,7 tips to survive working from home with your spouse,"Working from home with your partner might be fun for a few days (Lunch dates! Early dinners with no commutes!), but it could become a strain on your relationship after a while. ""The central task of any marriage is the management of differences,"" said Anthony Chambers, couple and family psychologist and chief academic officer at The Family Institute at Northwestern University.  ""Couples who are together now 24/7, any differences can become magnified. Often times when we stay away from each other for eight to 12 hours a day, that helps manage those problems."" Acknowledge the shift  This isn't going to be easy. There's a reason why we're told not to mix business with pleasure.  Take a minute to acknowledge the challenges that you might face and figure out a routine, suggested Chambers.  ""Being together now 24/7 can be very disruptive,"" he said.  Have a morning scrum  Now's the time to communicate ... often.  Take a few minutes each morning to evaluate the prior day and review today's schedule, recommended Melanie Katzman, a business psychologist. ""Discuss what worked yesterday and what didn't, what's on the schedule for today and ask, 'how can I help you succeed today?' or 'what is it you need from me?'"" she suggested.  Avoid the bedroom during work hours If possible, try and work in separate spaces and avoid setting up shop in the bedroom.  ""The bedroom needs to be a place where you just chat, sleep or be romantic,"" said Kathy Marshack, a psychologist in Oregon. ""You want it to be more of a family and couple space. Not your workspace."" Have a designated 'Do Not Disturb' place  There's nothing worse than being disrupted when you are on a roll with a project or have to really focus to meet a deadline.  Pinpoint workspaces or times of the day when you need absolute focus and ban any distractions.  At the same time, find ways to demonstrate you are available for interruption. For instance, sitting at the dining room table could mean you are taking care of emails and other lighter tasks that can handle a pause, while the door to the office being closed means do not disturb. Don't treat your spouse like a coworker  You might be sharing an office, but don't treat your spouse as your work coach, advised Katzman. Even though you miss brainstorming with your colleagues or turning to your office mate to discuss the awkwardness on the last conference call, don't just turn to your spouse.  You are likely already sharing added domestic and childcare duties, don't add work burdens on top of all that (plus, it's good to continue to stay in touch with your colleagues). ""It can almost add too much pressure if you are expecting your spouse to be the one source of everything,"" added Chambers. Have a code word  Things are going to get tough. There will be good days and bad days. To help mitigate any damage if you are feeling like you are about to explode, Katzman suggested having a code word that signals you need a break.  ""It can be an inside joke or a code word to be able to signal, 'I've had it, I can't even speak I am just about to burst,'"" she said.  Blame 'Frank' We could all use a scapegoat these days. So why not create an imaginary one to avoid pointing fingers?  ""Blaming an imaginary co-worker or house staff like: 'I can't believe XXX didn't take the dishes out of the dishwasher!' or 'XX is a such a loud worker!' breaks the tension,"" said Katzman. ""It breaks the tension, it's OK to laugh. We can't be in constant overdrive.""",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/economy/us-economy-coronavirus/index.html,It will be a devastating week for the US economy. There is no playbook -- and stimulus must come fast,"A sudden stop in the economy so severe, Goldman Sachs economists now forecast real GDP growth of negative 9% in the first quarter and down an astonishing 34% in the second. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the economy to recover mid-year with a 19% gain in the third quarter. The biggest economy in the world has stopped. The demise is so swift, it hasn't been reflected yet in the monthly data.  Consider Tuesday morning's consumer confidence report a bit of nostalgia. It will likely show consumers' confidence commensurate with a healthy economy.   Friday's monthly jobs report will barely begin to reflect the devastating fallout in the jobs market. (Possibly the first month of net jobs losses in a decade, but not the earthquake the weekly data are showing.) The survey period was the second week in March, a time when Americans were just waking up to the threat of the virus and social distancing had not yet been implemented.  Economists at Goldman Sachs predict the jobless rate with hit 15% by mid-year. The window into the carnage comes in the weekly data. We learned last week 3.28 million  Americans filed for jobless benefits for the first time.  This week will probably show millions more layoffs. Moody's Analytics chief economist forecasts another 4.5 million first-time filings for jobless benefits this week, which would be the highest in history. It all makes the quick and efficient rollout of the stimulus incredibly urgent. Promises from the White House to have stimulus checks direct-deposited in three weeks -- and small business loans available Friday -- are aggressive and absolutely necessary. Today is the end of a quarter and tomorrow the beginning of the month. That means bills are due for business and consumers. But the emergency government rescue funds have not arrived yet. And it can't end there. Rather than an actual ""stimulus,"" this record-setting effort is simply a life-preserver to keep Americans afloat. If done right, it may stop the losses. But more stimulus will have to come later, with more Congressional spending expected and lawmakers signaling they are willing. Meantime economists have no playbook here for the damage done to the economy.  In just seven weeks, the stock market crashed from record highs. At the worst, the Dow was down more than 30%. Then last week staged the biggest rally since the Great Depression. The violence of those moves reflects how unprecedented this automatic shut-off of the economy is. And the vast uncertainty of how -- and when -- it will restart.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/softbank-coronavirus-vision-fund/index.html,Masa Son's global tech empire is being rocked by the pandemic. Don't count him out just yet ,"Sweeping restrictions on work, travel and social interaction aimed at containing the pandemic could be catastrophic for many of the startups SoftBank CEO Son has plowed money into through his $100 billion Vision Fund, scaring investors just as they were banking on him to deliver a turnaround after a difficult year for the tech company.  Son is now trying to rescue SoftBank's plummeting share price, and last week made the surprise announcement of what amounts to a fire sale of $41 billion worth of assets to buy back shares and reduce the company's heavy debt load. SoftBank (SFTBY) didn't say what it plans to sell. And while the news sent its shares soaring by historic amounts last week, shedding assets and buying up its own stock isn't exactly a move befitting an aggressive investor who wants to shape the future for generations to come.  Son's 'radical change in strategy'  For Son, it is a surprising change of tack. Startled by the company's falling stock price earlier this month, SoftBank managers decided something drastic had to be done, according to Bernstein analyst Chris Lane. Describing the shift as a ""radical change in strategy"" Lane upgraded his recommendation on SoftBank from buy to outperform, noting that even if the value of Vision Fund startups halve, the stock is still cheap.  Part of that significant change is SoftBank signaling a step back from Son's high-risk style of investing. SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto said on an investor call last week that the company would be very conservative with new investments given the current economic climate, according to analysts from Bernstein and CLSA that were on the call. Spokespersons from SoftBank and the Vision Fund did not respond to requests for comment. Credit ratings agency Moody's was a lot more pessimistic about SoftBank's new approach than some analysts. Moody's pushed the company's credit further into junk status, citing its ""aggressive financial strategy.""  Selling SoftBank's ""highly-valued"" stakes in established companies such as China's Alibaba (BABA) or US mobile provider Sprint (S), just as the market is getting roiled by the pandemic, would drive down the value of its portfolio, Moody's said. SoftBank said the transactions will take place over the next year, but has not indicated what it is likely to sell. ""Asset sales will be challenging in the current financial market downturn, with valuations falling and a flight to quality,"" Motoki Yanase, Moody's vice president and senior credit officer, said last Wednesday.  SoftBank immediately pushed back on the downgrade, saying in a statement that Moody's had ""ignored"" the company's explanations. It accused the agency of having ""biased and mistaken views."" Rival ratings agency S&P, by contrast, said the asset sale could be good for SoftBank's credit quality.  The share price crash — the stock hit a near four-year low earlier this month — may have forced Son to tap the brakes on his global spending spree. But don't count him out just yet. He's been on the back foot before, and still stuck to his strategy of betting big on splashy tech firms and their eccentric founders.  Son lost billions when the dotcom bubble burst — 99% of his net worth was wiped out in 2000.  He also made his most famous investment the same year, putting $20 million into Alibaba, a fledgling Chinese e-commerce company. That bet turned into $60 billion when Alibaba went public in 2014. SoftBank has since sold some shares, but as of Monday, its 25.1% stake in Alibaba was still worth nearly $129 billion.  When people were criticizing internet companies 20 years ago, ""I had confidence and vision in [them],"" Son said at an earnings presentation in November. When it comes to artificial intelligence and the portfolio companies in the Vision Fund, ""we have the same confidence in them,"" he said. SoftBank and Vision Fund investments are exposed Still, a lot has changed since last fall. Forty percent of the Vision Fund portfolio is made up of transportation and logistics startups, companies that are among the most exposed to the global lockdowns. Son has spent some $33 billion buying stakes in companies such as Uber, Didi, Ola and Grab.  In February, at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the number of people using ride hailing app Didi plunged by nearly 60% in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, according to research company Arora Mobile. Didi's woes could be a harbinger of what's to come for Uber in the United States and Europe, Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.  Those ride hailing companies are facing steep losses because of the outbreak, according to Raymond Tsang, a partner with consulting firm Bain & Company. Most ride hailing firms aren't profitable, because they're burning through money to fend off rivals and gain market share. With the ""drain of cash"" caused by the pandemic, ""it will be harder for Didi, Grab, or any other mobility players to reach their breakeven point, or at least it will take them longer to sustain their economics,"" Tsang said. As of March 30, the Vision Fund was sitting on a loss of nearly $1.5 billion on its roughly 13% stake in Uber, according to CNN Business calculations. Shares in the car hailing company are down 33% from a recent high in early February, reversing a recovery Son had touted at an earnings presentation just last month. Stakes in real estate startups, which make up 10% of the Vision Fund portfolio, will also be hit.  WeWork is particularly vulnerable as major cities where it operates shut down for weeks on end. It still has to pay long-term leases, even if businesses squeezed by the outbreak cancel contracts with the shared office space company. To make matters worse, SoftBank is now reportedly backing away from part of its $10 billion bailout of the company.   IPO exits unlikely any time soon Earlier this month, Vision Fund head Rajeev Misra told CNBC that he expected dozens of the Vision Fund's companies to go public in the next 18 to 24 months.  Since then, the pandemic has worsened. Investments funds should now be prepared to hold onto their startups for longer than they anticipated, according to research firm PitchBook. Firms ""will be forced to hold struggling assets and may find exit markets to be completely subdued for most assets, particularly across the strategic [merger and acquisition] and IPO avenues,"" PitchBook analysts wrote in a note last week.    The coronavirus outbreak could also exacerbate a trend that began with WeWork's botched IPO last fall.  Son admitted that he had put too much faith in founder Adam Neumann, and the balance of power appears now to have shifted ""in favor of investors"" and away from ""founder-friendly terms"" and growth at all costs, the PitchBook analysts wrote.  Push back from investors could make it harder for Son and Misra to raise the $10 billion they are reportedly seeking to support Vision Fund portfolio companies grappling with the coronavirus outbreak.   One SoftBank-backed company that needed more money has already collapsed. OneWeb filed for bankruptcy last week. The company was not part of the Vision Fund portfolio, but had received about $2 billion from SoftBank.  The internet satellite startup was in talks with SoftBank to secure new funding, but the negotiations fell apart hours before OneWeb launched a batch of satellites into orbit on Saturday, according to a Financial Times report that was confirmed by CNN Business. Son may yet be right Son has been saying for years that a revolution is coming, when the use of artificial intelligence fundamentally changes how people live and work. And some are backing his vision — Chris Matthews, with CLSA, said the virus may help accelerate the global change on which Son has been fixated.  ""The coronavirus is, in our view, likely to drive adoption for the new disruptive technology companies in which Softbank Group has been investing,"" Matthews wrote in a note earlier this month.  Autonomously driven rides from Uber or Didi, for example, would have come in handy during this outbreak.  But Son's desire to raise even more money to support the Vision Fund during this crisis still worries some analysts.  Atul Goyal, of Jefferies, said last week that the market clearly doesn't think the Vision Fund has added any value to SoftBank, and if Son ""remains committed to raise funds for Vision Fund, the value destruction risk [to SoftBank] remains."" Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that SoftBank's OneWeb investment was held by the Vision Fund.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/perspectives/equal-pay-day-coronavirus/index.html,How the coronavirus widens the gender pay gap,"It's a challenging time for everyone, and both genders are at risk. Early evidence suggests that men are at increased risk for the coronavirus, possibly because men are more likely to smoke, drink and generally lead less healthy lives. Women, meanwhile, are more likely to feel the brunt of financial hardship as a result of the pandemic.  Here's how: According to PayScale's 2020 Gender Pay Gap Report, women currently make 81 cents for every $1 a man makes. This is the ""uncontrolled"" wage gap, meaning the gap that exists between men and women regardless of position, job level, location and other factors that impact compensation. The ""controlled"" pay gap is 98 cents, showing that even when work is equal, women are still valued a little less.  Part of the reason for the uncontrolled gender pay gap is that women are more represented in lower-paying jobs compared to men, who comprise a higher percentage of the professional sector. Women are also more represented in occupations with a social or service component. For example, 68% of community and social services workers are women, 70% of educators are women and 77% of personal care and service workers are women.  The coronavirus has hit service workers particularly hard, but the vast majority of the occupations dominated by women are at risk, as most depend on social interaction. With businesses and schools closing to enforce social distancing, women are more likely to face unemployment. In addition, women in these occupations make less than their male counterparts. For example, female elementary school teachers make 92 cents for every $1 a man makes when data are controlled. When it comes to the critical health care sector, the picture is again bleak for women. Women make up 75% of health care practitioners, 87% of health care support staff and 90% of nurses. Women are on the front lines in the fight against the coronavirus, working in hazardous conditions, and yet PayScale's gender pay gap research shows that women family doctors make 94 cents for every $1 male family doctors earn and female nurses make less than male nurses, 98 cents for every $1, when data are controlled for all compensable factors. As schools close, women are also more likely to suffer financial hardship due to the need to take time off to care for children. Research shows women who return to the workforce after taking time off to care for a family member — such as having children or caring for a sick relative — receive compensation offers that are 7% less when compared to an employee who applied for the same job while still in the workforce. Women have to wonder if taking time off to care for children and families because of the coronavirus pandemic will also have this effect. Mothers are already at a disadvantage. Well-documented research on the The Motherhood Penalty shows that women with children make less than women without children while men with children are compensated more. Although it is understandable that the gender pay gap is not a top concern at this moment in time, it's still important to recognize the damage that bias against women can do, erasing the gains we've made since the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements put pay equity in the spotlight.  Naturally, most employers don't intentionally pay women less, but unconscious bias creeps in. Before the coronavirus, 38% of organizations said they planned to pursue pay equity analysis in 2020. Whether or not that comes to pass in the near term or more distant future, we hope that employers consider the impact recent events have had on women financially, especially women returning after an absence. They should refuse to hire women back ""at a bargain"" when circumstances are brighter.   Ensuring pay equity for all employees is part of this equation. In uncertain times, employers would be well-served to modernize their compensation practices to price the job, not the person. This is one of the key ways businesses can show they value men and women equally for their contributions. There has been a great deal of positive momentum around closing the gender pay gap — momentum we don't want to lose, even in these uncertain times.",3/31/2020

""I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fevers, chills and shortness of breath,"" he wrote. ""I just hope I didn't give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse than this illness!""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/perspectives/stimulus-package-jobs/index.html,Former Trump adviser: The government stimulus will save millions of jobs,"I've said many times that it's crucial to keep as many people employed as possible during this crisis through an income replacement plan -- which this deal does for small businesses around the country. This approach allows workers to continue receiving a paycheck so they can provide for their families, while also preserving their employment so they can go back to work at the same company when the crisis ends.  At the same time, certain sectors have been hurt more than others, some of which have an outsized impact not only on current employment, but on our eventual recovery. The travel and entertainment industry, which was among the first and hardest hit, is a prime example. I could talk about any number of related businesses that should arguably be included in government support -- airlines, hotels, restaurants, car services and many other travel-related services. I will focus on the airlines given their significance in how we operate in a modern business environment and the number of jobs they support directly and indirectly. For the industry, the government support is necessary -- it will provide $25 billion in loans for passenger airlines, as well as $25 billion in grants specifically designed to pay airline employees through September 2020. For decades, US aviation has been vital to our economy. Not only do the airlines employ 750,000 people directly, the industry also drives $1.7 trillion in US economic activity and supports more than 10 million jobs across the country -- from gate agents and baggage handlers at our 5,000 public airports to manufacturers of airplanes and critical components; to government employees overseeing critical aviation infrastructure; to drivers transporting travelers to and from their flights every day.  Prior to COVID-19, America's airlines flew 2.4 million passengers every single day. In a country as vast as ours, air travel is essential for our way of life. And more broadly, it has supported many millions of Americans working in other industries and small businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, taxis and rideshares.                       US aviation and related businesses are now facing challenges the likes of which have never been seen. To give a sense of how dire the situation is, the Transportation Security Administration has reported that fewer than 180,002 people passed through TSA checkpoints on March 29th, a 2.3 million passenger drop -- or 93% decrease -- compared to the same day one year ago. Airlines have grounded the majority of their aircraft, deferred nearly all capital spending (including new aircraft deliveries, which has serious knock-on effects for American manufacturing), suspended capital return to shareholders, tapped into existing debt facilities, established new lines of credit whenever possible and reduced executive pay. Even with such significant self-help actions, companies just aren't able to sustain operations with little to no consumer demand. This robust stimulus package will not only ensure that millions of jobs are maintained by providing immediate necessary funding to keep workers employed, but will also ensure that the services we need now and in the future are readily available. To be sure, the politics of government relief to private companies are very complicated, and reasonable people can hold very different opinions on the topic. More support across more industries may in fact be needed. But the bottom line here is that we, as a country, want industries like the airlines to survive, and we need there to be competition to protect the best interests of the consumer. The same holds true for all other businesses in the travel-related industry.  Immediate government support is not meant to subsidize operations. It is not meant to be a free handout. Rather, it serves as a temporary bridge in response to a public health crisis so that these companies can continue to operate, support their people, protect employment and be ready to serve as the catalyst that our economy will need to lead the recovery. Through this intervention, our government has saved millions of jobs.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/social-media-doctors-coronavirus/index.html,Doctors turn to Twitter and TikTok to share coronavirus news,"But before the emergency physician steps on to his long shift and after he's done, he's on Twitter, usually for at least an hour a day. Raja, who is also the executive vice chair of Mass General's department of emergency medicine and a Harvard Medical School assistant professor, has been using Twitter to share information about coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, including personal protective equipment for medical professionals and the importance of social distancing, to his 57,000 followers, and to learn from other medical professionals. ""Right now, Twitter is the best way to get medical information out,"" Raja told CNN Business. ""Because of the fact that everybody gets a voice [on social media], it's very easy for alarmist messages to pick up steam. We have to be constantly vigilant about trying to get that panic under control and spread a different message."" In a sign of the times, doctors are effectively waging a two-pronged fight against coronavirus: one part takes place in overcrowded hospitals and the other takes place on noisy social media platforms as they work to combat what the World Health Organization has declared an infodemic with accurate, authoritative voices. All of that means doctors, some of whom were once reluctant to embrace social media, are wading deeper into platforms that are rife with fake news, unproven medical advice and mass panic.  ""Social media is the disease and the cure. It is responsible for the dissemination of misinformation as much as it needs to be a tool for repairing that,"" said Rick Pescatore, an emergency room physician and public health expert in the Philadelphia area, who is active on Twitter and Facebook and has treated Covid-19 patients. ""It's incumbent upon physicians, who want to get real information out there, to meet these patients where they are -- and that's social media.""  Fighting coronavirus misinformation where it lives  Perhaps nowhere is this shift more striking than on TikTok, a short-form video platform beloved by teens that is best known for lip syncing, dance routines and comedy skits.  In one TikTok video viewed more than 416,000 times, a registered nurse named Miki Rai does a choreographed dance involving a lot of hand motions as facts about Covid-19 flash on the screen, such as how long the virus stays on different surfaces. In another TikTok video, set to soothing elevator music, Dr. Rose Marie Leslie demonstrates proper handwashing: Wet hands. Lather up. Start washing for 20 seconds. Scrub under your nails and between fingers. Rinse.  Leslie, a resident physician specializing in family medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, created a TikTok account about a year ago, with the aim of reaching a younger demographic with health education information. Soon after coronavirus cases started emerging, she began creating TikToks about the issue. Now, she works to debunk myths about the virus for her more than 500,000 followers.  ""People have so many questions and they're looking at tweets or random Instagram posts that aren't necessarily from valid sources,"" Leslie said. ""My real goal was to take the messaging specifically from trusted sources and get it out to the broader community and also put it in a way that's palatable, that's quick nuggets of information presented in a short way."" She and other doctors are banding together through social media to settle on a framework of verifiable sources and information to share with the public. Some doctors are also reportedly turning to social media to develop Covid-19 treatments. ""[We] are all kind of talking to each other and coming up with unified messaging related to Covid-19 that's all coming from the trusted sources that we look to, like the World Health Organization, so that whenever somebody is looking through TikTok or YouTube, we can make sure that we're providing a unified message and getting the same information out to everybody,"" Leslie said.  In some sense, this is a return to one of the earlier goals of social media platforms like Twitter: providing accurate public health information. The account for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Twitter was one of the first to be verified on the platform. And yet, while some doctors on the platform have a blue checkmark next to their names on Twitter, others -- including Raja and Pescatore -- still do not. Doctors overcome their fear of social media The coronavirus pandemic could accelerate a shift in the medical community toward being more comfortable and active on social media after a long period of being apprehensive about it.  Some doctors, like Raja from Mass General, had privacy and safety concerns and worried that ""people might find me outside the emergency department."" Others worried about the impact it might have on their careers. ""There are concerns about if my hospital is going to smack me down for posting about this or that,"" said Pescatore. ""But as we all become more comfortable with it, I think more and more people are engaging with it."" On Twitter, a community known as #MedTwitter, has emerged, where medical professionals share information, discuss new research and learn from each other. Now, such communities are more critical than ever. ""The best place to learn is #MedTwitter,"" Raja said, who estimates that thousands of doctors are part of it. The doctors are not alone in their online fight against coronavirus. Other health groups, including the World Health Organization, the British Red Cross, the World Economic Forum, and the IFRC are posting Covid-19 information to TikTok, collectively amassing millions of followers. These organizations also have accounts on other social media platforms, including Twitter and YouTube.  But again and again, around the world, first-hand accounts from doctors have proven to be particularly powerful in shaping how the crisis is perceived, both inside and outside the medical community.  In one Twitter thread retweeted more than 131,000 times last week, Craig Spencer -- the director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center -- shared insight into his typical day on the frontlines of coronavirus in the emergency room, including gearing up in a gown, goggles, and mask to encounter sick patients and later wiping down all personal belongings like his wallet, phone and badge. His account led to plenty of press coverage.  ""You might hear people saying it isn't real. It is. You might hear people saying it isn't bad. It is. You might hear people saying it can't take you down. It can. I survived Ebola. I fear #COVID-19. Do your part. Stay home. Stay safe. And every day I'll come to work for you,"" Spencer tweeted.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/business/walmart-workers-gloves-masks-temperature-checks/index.html,Walmart will start taking employees' temperatures and let them wear masks,"Walmart will begin taking workers' temperatures at stores and warehouses before they begin their shifts. Any employee with a temperature above 100 degrees will be sent home to seek medical treatment, if necessary, but will be paid for showing up. The retailer will also make medical masks and gloves available for employees who want to wear them. ""They will be high-quality masks, but not N95 respirators — which should be reserved for at-risk healthcare workers,"" the company said. The CDC has recommended that healthy people do not need to wear personal protective gear. Still, some workers at Walmart, Amazon warehouses and other chains have expressed concerns that they do not have access to gloves or masks on the job and say they want to wear them.  ""If an associate feels more comfortable wearing masks, we want to give them that opportunity to do so,"" Dan Bartlett, spokesperson for Walmart, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.  As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, there is a nationwide face-mask shortage and even hospitals are struggling to get supplies. Walmart waited to secure protective gear to avoid limiting equipment that could go to strained health care workers and hospitals, Bartlett said. The company will need more than seven million masks each week for its employees, he said. The first shipment will arrive in one to two weeks. Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, with a workforce of around 1.5 million and 4,700 US stores. The company's decision may influence other chains' policies on masks and temperature screenings. Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), grocery stores and other retailers staying open during the crisis are under enormous pressure to balance meeting customer demand with protecting their workforce.  On Monday, a group of warehouse workers at Amazon and Instacart workers who fulfill grocery orders staged protests calling for their  companies to improve safety protections, pay and benefits during the coronavirus crisis. A group of Whole Foods workers has called for a ""sick out"" Tuesday over similar concerns. Amazon owns Whole Foods. Walmart says it is taking ""prudent"" steps to protect workers, according to  Bartlett. In recent weeks, Walmart and other large retailers have also installed sneeze guards at checkout and pharmacies and signs with instructions on social distancing. The company has shortened its hours, said it stepped up cleaning measures, and is using wipes and sprayers to clean down shopping carts. The company is working to add ""one-way"" aisles to promote social distancing, Bartlett said Tuesday. He encouraged shoppers to limit their trips to stores, although Walmart has not implemented any formal policies on the number of customers who can be inside at any one time.  ""They have to go somewhere to get food,"" he said. ""And so we're trying to find a way to strike that right balance to make sure that people have the access they need, but do it in the most responsible way."" Leonard Marcus, co-director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, said Walmart's measures should have been taken earlier but that retailers have been constrained by the lack of federal guidelines. ""Without overarching guidelines from the federal government, this has been a story of each state, each city, and each business doing it their own way,"" he said.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,Goldman Sachs now expects US unemployment to hit 15%,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. See here: Goldman Sachs has significantly downgraded its outlook for the US economy between April and June. The investment bank now expects an annualized rate of contraction of 34% compared to the previous quarter. The last estimate was an already-shocking 24%. Goldman revised its forecast because it thinks the US labor market collapse will be even worse than anticipated. It now sees the unemployment rate rising to 15% by the middle of the year, compared to 9% before. The bank has also updated its predictions for an economic rebound between July and September, which it thinks will be stronger than what it had last penciled in. But in the interim, Wall Street is clearly bracing for pain. The dismal forecast comes on a day of otherwise positive signs. China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index surged from 35.7 in February to 52 in March, surpassing estimates from analysts. Survey data also showed a rebound in other parts of the economy. A reading above 50 indicates growth compared to the previous month.  But that does not mean output has returned to levels seen before the coronavirus outbreak, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist from Capital Economics. It ""simply suggests that economic activity improved modestly relative to February's dismal showing,"" he said. More good news: Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank observed in a note to clients that ""the harsh containment measures which major parts of Europe started to impose some two weeks ago are apparently starting to work,"" slowing the rate of new infections. But that's just a small relief as the United States, home to the world's largest economy, becomes the new epicenter of the virus. In a new report, Deutsche Bank said it expects GDP in the United States and Europe to take a $2 trillion hit as a result of the pandemic. And that takes into account the unprecedented policy response. Retailers furlough tens of thousands of workers Macy's (M) and Gap (GPS) are furloughing tens of thousands of employees, part of a desperate bid to conserve cash as sales dry up. What happened: Macy's said Monday that it is furloughing the majority of its 125,000 employees. They'll still receive corporate health benefits at least through May. The retail chain, which also owns Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, shut all of its 775 stores in the United States earlier this month. Some states have forced the closure of nonessential businesses. Macy's said it had lost the ""majority"" of sales. Gap, meanwhile, said it would furlough most store workers in the United States and Canada. The company is reducing headcount across its corporate offices as well. ""After taking the extraordinary measures of temporarily closing all of our company-owned stores in North America and Europe two weeks ago, we are now in a position where we must take deeper actions,"" CEO Sonia Syngal said in a statement. What it means: The record $2 trillion US rescue package enacted last week isn't sufficient to stop layoffs in industries that have been hit hard by the virus and efforts to contain it.  And the cost savings haven't changed the calculus for skeptical investors, who have been steering clear of retail stocks. Shares of Macy's fell 2.9% on Monday. They're down more than 68% so far this year.  The worst quarter since the global financial crisis As March comes to a close, so does the first quarter — and the rout in the past month has proved painful. Global stocks are set for their worst quarter since the global financial crisis. The MSCI All-Country World Index is on track to have shed more than 21% between January and March. That's the index's worst performance since the fourth quarter of 2008, when it dropped nearly 23%. Some signs of stabilization have appeared in recent days. The MSCI All-Country World Index has climbed four of the past five trading days. Since March 23, it's up 15.9%, helped by a rally in US stocks. Morgan Stanley pointed out in a recent note to clients that stock markets tend to look ahead, reaching their low points four to five months before the economy troughs. ""If the cycle were to bottom around summer 2020, based on our economists' growth forecasts, we should start to see equity markets bottom soon,"" the investment bank's strategists said. But the road ahead still looks rocky. The key risk, according to Morgan Stanley, is the trajectory of US and European Covid-19 cases, which should become clearer over the next week.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/tech/amazon-worker-fired-staten-island-warehouse/index.html,Amazon fires warehouse worker who led Staten Island warehouse walkout,"Amazon (AMZN) confirmed the firing Monday night, telling CNN Business in a statement that the employee, Christian Smalls, was supposed to be under quarantine.  ""Mr. Smalls was found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14 days, which is a measure we're taking at sites around the world,"" said Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish. ""Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, putting the teams at risk."" The firing follows the protest partly organized by Smalls, who had called on Amazon to shut down the Staten Island facility for deep cleaning after multiple cases of the coronavirus emerged there. In an interview on Sunday, Smalls told CNN he had spent the past week trying to persuade senior warehouse officials to close the building and sterilize it, but to no avail.  New York is grappling with the worsening coronavirus outbreak. The state has seen more than 66,000 people sickened by the virus, and more than 1,000 deaths.  Monday's protest saw more than a dozen people walk off the job at around lunchtime, according to Amazon and a livestream of the event viewed by CNN.  In a phone interview Monday night after his firing, Smalls said he is being singled out for punishment and that his firing reflects a culture of apathy at Amazon.  ""Everybody's been warning me that [this] might happen, so I kinda expected it,"" Smalls said. ""But for them to do it this way, and for the reasoning behind it, that tells you right there that they, number one, don't care about people, and number two, it's just a target, a straight up target."" Smalls said he next intends to visit City Hall to persuade local government officials to intervene.  New York Attorney General Letitia James said late Monday evening that ""it is disgraceful that Amazon would terminate an employee who bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues."" ""At the height of a global pandemic, Chris Smalls and his colleagues publicly protested the lack of precautions that Amazon was taking to protect them from COVID-19,"" she said. ""Today, Chris Smalls was fired. In New York, the right to organize is codified into law, and any retaliatory action by management related thereto is strictly prohibited."" James also called for an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. On Tuesday, Smalls told CNN that he intends to file a complaint with the NLRB.  ""Legal action will be taken in due time,"" Smalls said.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-world-bank-asia-intl-hnk/index.html,"The coronavirus pandemic could push 11 million people in Asia into poverty, World Bank warns","In the worse-case scenario outlined by the Washington-based financial institution, the region could suffer its sharpest downturn in more than two decades, plunging much of Asia into a prolonged recession.  The bank's baseline forecast projects that regional growth could slow to 2.1% in 2020, compared to estimated growth of 5.8% in 2019. However, under its worse case projection, the region's economy could contract by 0.5%, creating the potential for an extended crisis. In China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, the bank projected a decline in growth to 2.3% in the baseline forecast for 2020. In the worse case, China's growth would almost disappear entirely at 0.1%, down from 6.1% in 2019.  Such a reduction would have profound consequences for the global economy. The last time China experienced a shrinking economy was in 1976, when the death of Communist Party leader Mao Zedong ended more than a decade of social and economic tumult inside the country. Unlike then, however, China is now the world's second largest economy and a primary engine of global growth, meaning that any disruption to its economy will be felt worldwide. ""Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries,"" said the report, warning that the entire Asia Pacific region should prepare for ""a serious impact"" on poverty and welfare, through illness, death, and lost incomes. The report noted that although the estimates were projections, and could yet change, they served to underscore the scale of potential economic damage and the subsequent need for urgent action. ""All countries in the East Asia and Pacific region and beyond must recognize that, in addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat,"" said the report.  In an attempt to mitigate against the economic shock, the World Bank has pledged to provide $14 billion in financial support to developing countries and deploy up to $160 billion over 15 months to protect the poor and vulnerable.  Economic pain in Asia Pacific Fears of a region-wide recession have grown in recent weeks, as the virus continues to spread throughout much of Asia, resulting in widespread enforced lockdowns, with travel suspended, stores shuttered and factories closed.  The crisis in Asia-Pacific is particularly acute because the region had already spent months dealing with the negative economic effects of the US-China trade war. Economic growth in the region will ""decline significantly in all scenarios,"" said the report. Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines will likely be harder hit, while Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia and Myanmar are the few countries expected to see growth — just at significantly lower levels than last year. These countries will be especially impacted by a drop in tourism over the coming months; in countries like Malaysia or Thailand, tourism revenues make up more than 10% of GDP. International border closures and disruptions in aviation or shipping industries will also pose challenges for manufacturing exports. Many of these countries already had weak or developing economies — meaning the shock of the coronavirus outbreak could leave millions trapped in dire poverty, defined as income of $5.50 a day or less. According to the report, the economic fallout would see nearly 24 million fewer people across East Asia and the Pacific escape poverty in 2020 under a baseline scenario. While under the bank's lower case scenario, poverty is estimated to increase by about 11 million people. The stark forecast contrasts sharply with the bank's previous projection prior to the outbreak, that estimated that nearly 35 million people would escape poverty in the region in 2020, including over 25 million in China alone.  The report projected that poverty rates could double in households that are particularly vulnerable, like those linked to manufacturing or tourism.  What needs to be done The rate and ease of recovery in these places will depend on how quickly the pandemic can be contained, said the report. That's why early containment and mitigation measures are key. The report pointed to Singapore and South Korea as examples of effectively containing the virus without severely damaging the economy, and credited their success to high levels of testing, tracking, and quarantine. These countries learned from previous epidemics like the 2003 SARS outbreak, and invested in disease surveillance and response systems. The sooner other countries can follow suit, the sooner they can get through this and recover, the report said. Governments will also need to implement a range of measures to soften the blow on their citizens, and prevent a rise in poverty as much as possible. These include subsidies for sick pay, liquidity injections to help small and medium enterprises stay in business, and school feeding or other support for students affected.  Finally, countries must work together and support each other in such dire times. This means keeping global trade open, sharing the supply of key medical products, or even eliminating tariffs on these medical products. ""All countries in the East Asia and Pacific region and beyond must recognize that, in addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat,"" the report said.",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/success/work-from-home-tips/index.html,How to work from home without losing your sanity,"As coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country, companies are asking employees to work remotely to help control contagion.  At first, working from home might seem like a dream: no commute, no distracting co-workers and think of all those chores you'll be able to sneak in!  But after the novelty wears off, things get real. It can be lonely. Your home suddenly feels a lot smaller. And there's no real end to your work day.  ""I think the biggest thing that is underestimated is the psychological impact of being alone,"" said David Hassell co-founder and CEO of 15Five, a performance management software provider, where 40% of the workers are remote. Here are some tips to stay well-balanced:  Take a break Let's be honest: You don't work eight hours straight in the office. There are coffee breaks, lunch walks and chats with co-workers that give some respite from work.   Just because you are working from home doesn't mean you aren't entitled to the same breathers. ""There is a tendency to work throughout the day to overcome some stigma that you aren't working when not in the office,"" said David Rabin, vice president of global commercial marketing at Lenovo.  Hitting the pause button throughout the work day can be a boon to productivity.  ""It's not going to take anything from your effectiveness,"" said Julie Morgenstern, an organization and productivity consultant and author of ""Organizing from the Inside Out."" ""Stepping away for breaks are part of productivity; they actually make you smarter and give you perspective and answers."" Get structured, but not too much  It will take a little time to get into your groove working from a different environment.  If you were the office worker who liked to bounce around from your desk to a conference room table to a private meeting room to get your work done, don't feel like you have to limit yourself to one spot in your house, advised Rabin. But be thoughtful about where you choose to work and make sure to match the environment to the type of work you are doing, suggested Morgenstern. For instance, find a quiet area to work for some deep thinking, while sitting outside on your patio might work to respond to emails and other housekeeping-type tasks.  And make sure to designate some places as work-free zones. ""You should preserve some spaces in your home that you never do work in,"" she added. ""It is very hard to relax at night when you start to associate those spaces with work."" Repurpose your commute  A major perk of working from home is ditching the commute. But that doesn't mean your work day can start earlier.  ""Use your commute time in the morning for self-renewal or family time, not work,"" recommended Morgenstern.    Set very clear boundaries  ""Working from home doesn't mean you are working more hours,"" warned Morgenstern. Be clear with your manager and coworkers of your schedule and stick to it.  And when your work day ends, put away your work equipment and change into your evening or lounge clothes to help signal the shift to personal time.  You also have to be clear with the other members of your household who might be wanting your attention during the workday. This could be particularly challenging if schools close. ""Create some structure to the day and designate play and work time while organizing space into work and play areas, recommended Morgenstern. ""You have to impose some order."" Show your face When possible, use video over the standard conference call to help create more interactions and avoid loneliness.  Three times a week all the employees at 15Five, whether they work from home or are in the office, get on a video call, for an all-hands meeting.  ""We can see everyone's faces since everyone is on their own laptop with their own camera -- that is really important,"" said Hassell.  Force social collisions  Working from home means no popping into your colleague's office to chat or running into someone on your way to the bathroom and discussing weekend plans.  ""When those drive-by connections are missing,"" said Morgenstern, ""If you are energized by being around other people, it can be despairing.""  But social interaction can still happen from home -- you just have to be more proactive. Set up regular check-ins with your team or manager that allows you to not only provide progress updates, but also sort through any problems or brainstorm ideas. Use FaceTime, Zoom and other video tools during meetings or just to chat with coworkers to help avoid loneliness.  At 15Five, there are two Slack channels that provide a discussion space for workers.  One is more formal where people discuss what they are working on and other business-related subjects while the other one, called ""water-cooler,"" is more casual, where people post more personal messages and funny images.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/success/recession-proof-investments/index.html,How to recession-proof your investments,"With markets becoming more volatile this week, it's a good time to figure out if you're ready to weather an impending storm. ""Recession-proofing your portfolio and financial life is particularly important during a time like this, when everyone knows a recession will come eventually, but no one knows when,"" said Ben VerWys, senior financial adviser at Action Point Financial in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  While the economy is still strong and unemployment is still relatively low, it's a good opportunity to re-evaluate your goals, rebalance your portfolio and review your debt and cash levels. Re-evaluate your goals  First, consider how many years away you are from needing to take distributions from your portfolio in retirement, said Jarodd White, financial planner with Vitalize Capital Management in Milwaukee. ""The shorter your time horizon, the higher the need is to move assets from more volatile to less volatile strategies."" Next, consider whether you're taking on the right amount of risk. You can stress test your current holdings in a variety of ways, but looking at how you may have fared in past downturns is a simple way to do it. Brett N. Fry, a certified financial planner at Forteris Wealth Management in Dallas, said he shows his clients how their portfolio would have performed during past downturns, like the recession of 2008 or the bursting of the tech bubble in 2001.  ""Often the investor says they could not stomach that sort of loss or volatility,"" he said. ""Then we know their current portfolio is too risky and they should dial back."" Based on your financial goals, set out a plan for when you plan to withdraw your money and put it in writing.  ""A withdrawal policy statement is a tool for removing the impact of emotion on your portfolio and defining exactly what you will and won't do when a correction occurs,"" said Jonathan Bird, a certified financial planner with Farnam Financial in Phoenix, Arizona.  Rebalance your portfolio Getting ready for the next recession is different now than in the past, said VerWys. Stock market valuations are currently higher than historical norms but interest rates have also been extremely low.  ""Historically, a smart move going into a recessionary period is to reduce stock risk and shore up on bonds,"" he said. ""Yet, this time that may not be what actually makes sense in light of low interest rates and low bond yields to investors.""  With the S&P 500 providing a 1.81% dividend yield and the 10-Year Treasury bond falling to historic lows at around 1.3%, it's understandable why money continues to flow into stocks over the past year, said Mike Silane, managing partner at 21 West Wealth Management in Irvine, California. But those who need to access the funds in their portfolio over the next few years should consider taking some of their gains and reinvesting them in short-term bonds, CDs or money market accounts, he said. The decision about when to sell a stock that's performed well is never easy.  ""Selling, or not selling, is often met with regret or missed opportunity,"" Silane said. But it doesn't have to be an all or nothing decision. Consider selling one half or one third of your position. ""By selling a portion of your holdings you are at least partially right no matter what happens."" Longer-term investors -- those looking at horizons of ten years or more until retirement -- should not try to time the market but rather more broadly diversify their portfolio into other equity classes or styles of investing, he said. While large cap growth stocks have been strong market drivers over the decade, investors should consider adding exposure to value stocks which have lower valuations and higher dividend yields, Silane said. ""Growth stocks tend to get hit much harder during recessions as their lofty valuations get compressed and their lower yields or no dividend yields at all, make them less attractive investments when times get tough,"" he said. Review debt and cash levels Before a financial downturn hits, work to pay down your debt and increase your savings while you can.  ""It is vital that during a recession you stay away from debt as debt magnifies losses,"" said Silvia Manent, a certified financial planner at Manent Capital in Boston. ""Using leverage these past ten years has been very rewarding, but it's important to slowly scale back."" Ensuring that you have access to cash during a downturn can also be the key to weathering the storm. ""The best thing that people can do to recession-proof themselves is to have access to cash in some type of emergency fund,"" said Pamela J. Horack, a certified financial planner with Pathfinder Planning outside Charlotte, North Carolina.  During the Great Recession, mortgage holders with more cash on hand experienced lower levels of loan default, according to research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which showed borrower's liquidity can be more important than borrower's equity. ""The people hit hardest were the ones with no real savings,"" Horack said. ""These families had mortgage payments, credit card bills and funds in their 401(k) for retirement, but didn't have an emergency fund they could easily access. With a job loss, they had no income, no emergency fund, and were already one month behind on bills."" ",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/energy/gas-prices-two-dollars/index.html,Gas prices fall below $2 a gallon on average in the United States,"The plunge can be attributed to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has wiped out demand as people are increasingly told to shelter at home. The ongoing oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia has exacerbated that decline. Not even two weeks ago, the price of a gallon of gas was $2.19, but could be purchased for $2 or less in about a dozen of states. Today, drivers can find a gallon of gas for $1.99 or less at roughly 70% of US gas stations, AAA said.  ""This is unprecedented,"" Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN Business at the time.  AAA said in a press release Tuesday that it expects gas prices to fall to $1.75 or less in April. Kloza, however, predicts they will continue to drop beyond that, to between $1.25 to $1.50 per gallon in the next few months.  Oil prices have been declining steadily this year. US crude plunged nearly 7% and finished at an 18-year low of $20.09 a barrel Monday as the coronavirus continues to deal a devastating blow to energy demand. At session lows, oil touched $19.27 a barrel -- the weakest intraday price since February 2002. Brent crude, the world's benchmark, tumbled as much as 13% and fell to as low as $21.65 a barrel, its lowest point in 18 years. Brent settled at $22.76 a barrel, the lowest close since November 2002.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/stock-market-bear-market-coronavirus/index.html,"The Dow has spiked nearly 4,000 points in a week. That doesn't mean the crisis is over","The Dow has skyrocketed 3,736 points, or 20%, over the past week. The stunning rally is raising hopes that the devastating coronavirus bear market may already be over, or at least that the lows of the crisis have been put in.  But the 2008 meltdown showed that the road to recovery can be treacherous, with countless potholes along the way.   The bottom of this cycle won't truly come until there is evidence the deadly pandemic is under control, paving the way for a recovery in the economy.  ""Unfortunately, I think we're heading lower as people come to the grips with the fact that businesses can't operate for quite some time,"" said Sam Hendel, president of value manager Levin Easterly Partners.   Best week since FDR That's not to say this comeback is insignificant. It has been quite impressive.  The Dow spiked 12.8% last week, its biggest weekly percentage gain since June 1938. The S&P 500 notched its best three-day return since 1933.   And US stocks kicked off this with on a strong note. The S&P 500 rallied another 3.4%. It is now up 17.4% from its March 23 low, nearing the 20% threshold needed to declare the bear market over.  That powerful rally is being driven by hopes that the US economy could soon reopen and relief over the rescue policies swiftly cobbled together by Washington.   The Federal Reserve taking unprecedented steps to prevent a full-blown financial crisis, and Congress and the White House rushed through a $2 trillion stimulus package -- the largest in American history.   ""Markets stop panicking when policy makers start panicking,"" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report to clients late last week.   Millions of jobs are disappearing But the economic toll has only just begun to get tallied.   Last week, the Labor Department said unemployment claims skyrocketed to 3.3 million. That was nearly five times above the previous record set in 1982.  Economists have warned that despite the stimulus package, second-quarter GDP will collapse by the most on record. And their forecasts for a rebound in the second half of 2020 are based on the assumption that the virus will get under control.  The 2008 playbook The sharp spike in stock prices doesn't mean the worst is necessarily over. Veterans of the last bear market learned that the hard way.   The S&P 500 scored six different rallies of 9% or more between September 2008 and December 2008, according to Goldman Sachs. But the benchmark didn't bottom until March 2009.   ""Bear markets are often punctuated by sharp bounces before resuming their downward trajectory,"" David Kostin, Goldman's US chief equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients Sunday.   RBC Capital Markets notes that US stocks have taken an eerily similar route to the one of a dozen years ago. ""If the S&P 500 continues down the 2008 path, this playbook suggests it could trade as high as 2730 before turning lower again,"" Lori Calvasina, RBC's head of US equity strategy, wrote in a report on Monday.   The S&P 500 finished at 2627 on Monday.  ""We're still skeptical US equities have seen their low for the year,"" Calvasina wrote.   Shortest bear market ever? One reason for that skepticism: It normally takes a great deal of time for stocks to recover from severe losses. Yet there were just 23 trading days between the S&P 500's record high last month and the recent low.   ""It would mark the fastest and most volatile bear market decline on record,"" Kostin said.   Bear markets are typically measured in months, not days. The median bear has lasted 17 months, according to Goldman Sachs. None of them have lasted fewer than three months.  Although Goldman Sachs is still confident the S&P 500 will soar back to 3,000 by the end of the year, the Wall Street investment bank is telling clients to brace for more turbulence ahead.   ""We believe it is likely that the market will turn lower in coming weeks, and caution short-term investors against chasing this rally,"" Kostin wrote.   But no one can say for sure. There has never been a bear market triggered by a shutdown of the US economy like this one. And never before have policymakers responded so forcefully.  ""America has a history of overcoming adversity, with a vengeance,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, which manages $2.25 billion.  One major obstacle is that Corporate America -- the biggest buyer of US stocks during the last bull market -- has effectively been sidelined.   Everyone from Chevron (CVX) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have suspended their buyback programs because of the coronavirus crisis.  Nearly 50 US companies have halted existing buyback programs over the past two weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. These suspensions represent $190 billion of buybacks, or nearly 25% of the total from last year.   That vanishing demand from US companies will translate to higher volatility and lower valuations, Goldman Sachs said.  Health crisis hasn't peaked yet  Goldman Sachs laid out a three-part ""checklist for a sustained rally"":  Clear signs the coronavirus outbreak is slowing Evidence the government's monetary and fiscal stimulus is effectively limiting layoffs and bankruptcies Investor positioning and sentiment is bottoming  It remains very murky when the coronavirus pandemic will peak. But it's clear that the worst has not yet arrived, suggesting an unimaginable human toll. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned on CNN over the weekend that 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the virus.   New York is the epicenter of the outbreak, but other states including Louisiana, Indiana and Arizona have recently reported infection spikes.   ""We're still in the early stage of this spreading out of the blue states and into the red states,"" said Hendel, the president of Levin Easterly Partners.   It will be very difficult to confidently declare an all-clear in the stock market until the end of the pandemic is in sight.  ",3/31/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/craft-brewers-coronavirus-closures-layoffs/index.html,American craft brewers were already in trouble. Then came coronavirus,"In 2019, more than 300 small and independent brewers closed -- the largest total in a single year. Sales at the high-overhead operations shrank as the market overflowed with competition: A record 8,000-plus breweries were scattered across the US in 2019, a fivefold increase in a decade's time.  It was anticipated several hundred more would go dark in 2020. But as winter turned to spring -- a time when brewers typically gear up for the busy summer season -- the rough patch turned disastrous. Potential outlets for beer sales shut off in quick succession. Several states seeking to blunt the spread of coronavirus ordered weekslong closures or drastically scaled-back operations of businesses that were once reliant upon being communal gathering places.  Much like others in the hospitality and food-service business, breweries have resorted to conducting large-scale layoffs, running on skeleton crews, and, in some cases, permanently shutting down operations.  ""As a small brewer, we've been struggling for a bit,"" said Dan Watson, co-owner of Cleophus Quealy Beer Company in San Leandro, California. The founders started taking stock of the operation when Cleophus Quealy hit its five-year mark in 2019. Small breweries like theirs need to sell enough beer to pay the bills. Specializing in sour, fruited and barrel-aged beers, which can take months to develop, that volume wasn't always there. Competition grew from both the arrival of new entrants and also acquisition moves by the multinational beer-makers. ""So many bottles and brands,"" Watson said. ""It's a really crowded space to compete in. We increasingly have depended on people who live in the area."" When the Bay Area's coronavirus ordinances were put into place, it resulted in the temporary closure of the taproom where 75% of Cleophus Quealy's sales took place. The brewery's founders opted to close the business entirely and funnel all remaining sales to the brewery's seven employees.  ""It just became pretty clear that this was not a thing we could weather through,"" Watson said.  Charlotte's Legion Brewing laid off 90% of its workers -- about 135 people -- in a move intended to be temporary; Ska Brewing closed its brand new ""brewstillery"" in Colorado, 71 minutes after opening; in Austin, Texas, Jester King let go of longtime workers after losing the source for 77% of its sales. ""On top of that, the remaining 23% of our sales are in limbo, given the evidence we've seen of distributors and retailers being hyper-cautious in these uncertain times,"" Jester King's founder Jeffrey Stuffings wrote in a blog post. ""All in all, but for the yet-to-be-determined impact of to-go only sales, we're in a position where 100% of our revenue is in jeopardy."" The curveball flung into operations forced brewers to scramble and get creative. The unexpected shift in operations created a bottleneck in the supply chain for to-go packaging. Crowlers, the large aluminum cans that can typically hold two pints, are on back order.  Brewers desperate to find ways of selling the beer that's sitting in tanks have flooded craft beer delivery site Tavour with calls, texts and emails, said Meghan Packard, vice president of the Seattle-area operation. ""I literally cannot keep up with the calls and the emails and the outcry from breweries,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, we can't take every brewery."" Shifting gears Other brewers' resourcefulness turned into unanticipated business ventures.  Yellowhammer Brewing, a 10-year-old craft brewery and distillery in Huntsville, Alabama, repurposed its entire production line to make hand sanitizer.  After getting the nod from federal agencies and securing hydrogen peroxide and glycerol from one of its chemical suppliers, Yellowhammer switched to full production of hand sanitizer at 4 a.m. on Monday, March 23. The initial production is intended for large organizations such as medical providers, civic agencies and nonprofits in need, said Ethan Couch, Yellowhammer co-founder. ""The only sad part is all of this just takes time,"" Couch said, noting the process itself as well as a recommended 72-hour rest for the system post-production to ensure no bacterial action is occurring in the vessel.  Help is on the way, but draft beer is in trouble The passage of the $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus would be a ""good first step"" for small and independent breweries, said Bob Pease, president and chief executive officer of the Brewers Association, the trade organization for craft brewers. The loans and forgivable provisions could help brewers stay afloat, he said.  About 40% of craft brewers' beers are sold via draft, with 26% distributed through a second party such as a restaurant or bar and the remaining 14% at the brewery itself, said Bob Pease, president and chief executive officer of the Brewers Association, the trade organization for craft brewers. ""If you don't put your beer in bottles or cans right now, you are the most at risk because you don't have a path to market,"" he said. ""[Packaged brewers] that are decently capitalized, we believe most of those breweries should make it through."" The situation hasn't been easy for brewers of all sizes.  Russian River Brewing Company, the brewer known for its highly rated Pliny the Elder Double IPA, temporarily laid off 159 people, or 80% of its staff, at its two North Bay breweries -- locations that just a month earlier attracted hordes of visitors who waited in hourslong lines to purchase the even rarer Pliny the Younger Triple IPA. The brewery scaled back production by 50%, stopped kegging beer entirely and switched to solely packaged beer, Natalie Cilurzo, Russian River's co-owner and president, wrote in an email to CNN Business.  ""These are unprecedented and crazy times,"" Cilurzo said. ""I'm not sure any of us had an emergency plan for a global pandemic.  But we survived a Great Recession, wildfires, floods, and PG&E power shutdowns, and I am confident we will get through this one, too."" She added: ""I miss our employees the most.""",3/27/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/tech/esports-sports-canceled-coronavirus/index.html,"Esports are already online (obviously), but the pandemic is still creating huge challenges","Some companies, including the Electronic Sports League, Riot Games and Activision Blizzard (ATVI), resumed their competitions online after pulling events in the US, Europe and Asia with a brief hiatus or no delay. ""It's pretty incredible that both Overwatch League and Call of Duty League will be the only city-based leagues still fortunate enough to operate in this current environment,"" Pete Vlastelica, president and CEO of Activision Blizzard Esports, said in a statement to CNN Business.  ""I miss traditional sports, like we all do. At the same time I'm proud our leagues can compete online,"" he said, noting that Call of Duty League is still delayed but will be back online ""soon."" Activision did not comment on the delay. Esports experienced a 37% increase in the average number of viewers per tournament last quarter, compared to the same period last year, according to Stream Hatchet, a video game analytics company. As the esports industry draws more viewership online, it's also attracting new interest in a world where traditional sports are on pause. ""The changing environment is turning both consumer and advertiser attention toward the gaming video content space, with esports being part of this,"" said Nicole Pike, managing director of Nielsen Esports.  Pro athletes are spending more time playing and streaming video games, and the US Navy recently launched an esports team called ""Goats & Glory."" (The United States Naval Academy's mascot is Bill the Goat.) The US Army and the US Air force already have esports teams. ""With esports being a billion dollar industry and millions of consumers, it was definitely a space we wanted to get into,"" Captain Matt ""Smoke"" Boren, chief marketing officer of the Navy Recruiting Command, told CNN Business. ""At a time where a lot of people's activities have been disrupted, [sailors] can't do face-to-face team activities anymore. It's just a safe place to go to."" Esports have long copied the playbook of traditional sports, organizing glitzy in-person events that emulate the Super Bowl and the Olympics. Some are now canceled. In February, an Electronic Sports League event ran without a live audience due to concerns by state officials in Katowice, Poland about coronavirus. ""We suddenly had to scramble and tell everyone, 'Don't come,'"" said Craig Levine, global chief strategy officer of ESL (Electronic Sports League).  Although some fans complained about the change on social media, online viewership for the ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" tournament was record-breaking, said Levine, although the 11,000-person stadium in which it was held was eerily empty except for players and staff.  Riot Games, creator of ""League of Legends,"" announced last November that it would host its annual World Championship in Shanghai, China but that plan is in now in doubt. The annual event typically falls in November. It might mean doing without a live audience or becoming an online-only event. ""We're scenario-planning around all our options,"" said Riot Games' head of partnerships Naz Aletaha.  For now, Riot's advertisers are understanding, she said. The video game company currently has deals with Mercedes-Benz in China, Louis Vuitton, MasterCard, State Farm and others. When an esports event goes fully online, it creates disruption for gaming companies and their participants. There are fewer gigs for the freelancers who normally work those events. And instead of having a referee onsite, players must be monitored from their homes to guarantee none cheat. Companies increasingly require players to install tracking software and cameras in their homes.  Players may also face different internet speeds rom their home countries when they compete in a global event. ESL's Levine said that for now, regional events are being held to prevent this issue. It's unclear whether companies can recoup losses from canceled in-person events with increased viewership into ad and partnership revenue.  For the ESL, the increase in Twitch views doesn't translate ""dollar for dollar"" into revenue, according to Levine. And the company bore a significant loss when it had to refund tickets for its Polish event. ""We're not able to directly benefit from [increased viewership of online only games]. But we've been around for 20 years and we're big believers,"" said Levine, who noted that such events cost much less to run than physical ones. ""We'll be surviving and thriving.""",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/business/equal-pay-day-trnd/index.html,Today is Equal Pay Day for women and it's not a day to celebrate,"Every year, the National Committee on Pay Equity sets a date for ""Equal Pay Day"" to highlight the overall pay disparity between men and women who work full-time in the United States. This year, Equal Pay Day is March 31. Overall, women earn 81.6 cents for every dollar that men make, according to the most recent US Census data.  By race, the numbers tell a different story. Compared to other women of color, Asian American and Pacific Islander women are on the higher end of the wage gap earning on average 92 cents for every dollar earned by men. If you break it down into specific Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, the wage gap grows.  Native American women have to work into the fall to hit the same salary as men do, and Latina women are on the job until early November. Here's a list of what women by other racial groups make compared to white men, and their Equal Pay Day for 2020:  Asian American and Pacific Islander women: February 11, $0.92Black women: August 13, $0.62 Native American women: October 1, $0.57Latina women: November 2, $0.54 The good news is that the overall gender wage gap is closing.  Women made 82% of what men made in 2018, compared with 60.5% in 1969, according to the American Association of University Women.  The closing of the gender wage gap could be due to a number of factors, such as women obtaining higher levels of education and going into fields that were normally dominated by men. In addition, women have been advocating more for their rights and bringing more awareness to the issue.  ""Some of the #MeToo movement definitely would have to do with equal pay and making sure that women get their due in the workplace,"" Elise Gould, senior economist at Economic Policy Institute told CNN. ""It's not just equal pay. It's also promotions and opportunities.""  While the gender wage gap is definitely closing in, Shannon Williams of the Equal Pay Today campaign believes there's still a lot to be done, especially on the legislative front, such as passing the Paycheck Fairness Act.  Because ""when women do well, everybody does well,"" Williams said.  ""If women could be making what they should be making, what their male counterparts are making, the economy would be doing much better,"" Williams said. ""If we're really serious about making sure that women, particularly women of color are earning the money that they deserve, then we need to make sure that we're making our voices heard this (election) year.""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/perspectives/financial-literacy-pay-gap/index.html,We're not talking to our girls enough about money,"The social issues behind the statistics are complicated and deep-rooted, but not unsolvable. And financial literacy — possessing the financial knowledge, skills and behavior to confidently and effectively manage financial resources for a lifetime of financial well-being — can be a big part of the solution, not just for ourselves but for future generations of women.  Recently, Charles Schwab conducted a survey that looked at the money attitudes and experiences of young Millennials (ages 21 to 25) and Generation Z (ages 16 to 20) — both men and women. Although studies of previous generations have shown that women dramatically trail men in both their confidence and knowledge of saving and investing, my hope was that the survey results would indicate that things had changed. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. While the survey did show that young women are interested in finance, want to be financially independent, and are taking on extra jobs and spending less than men, they still have less savings and were only about half as likely as young men to have an investment account. This is why financial literacy is so important. With less of a financial head start and more hurdles to face, women simply cannot afford to make ill-informed financial decisions on buying, saving, investing and managing debt.   The evidence is mounting that financial education matters. In a national study by FINRA, individuals who have participated in a substantial amount of financial education were found to be more likely to save and less likely to overdraw their checking accounts. Additionally, nearly half of Americans (49%) who received more than 10 hours of financial education reported spending less than they earn, compared with 36% of those people who received less than 10 hours of financial education.  We can turn this around As parents, we have the biggest opportunity of all. Our kids learn from everything we do, whether that's intentional or not. We need to set a good example. Talk to your girls in the same way you talk to your boys. Teach them equally about budgeting, saving and investing. Gender differences in financial literacy may be traced to a combination of socioeconomic factors, but also include differences in opportunities for learning. Confidence and competence increase when girls have more opportunities to learn. Share your stories. Have open conversations with your daughters as you budget, make spending decisions, save and invest. Talk to them about the difference between stocks and bonds. Discuss the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF. Show them your 401(k) statements if you're comfortable doing so. Explain how a mortgage works, and why the interest rate matters. These everyday conversations add up and can have as much impact as a formal class or education. Even before your daughter enters the workforce, talk to her about the wage gap and help her become confident in negotiating hiring terms and salary. Starting with her first job, encourage her to set aside a portion of her earnings for retirement and invest that long-term money in the stock market. Don't assume that she will learn about money in the workplace or at school.  As we celebrate International Women's Day, my greatest wish is for every young woman to appreciate her potential and her worth. Our daughters deserve to have the same professional opportunities and salaries as our sons, and the same financial know-how and security throughout their lives. We have a tremendous opportunity to make a lasting impact on the next generation by giving all our children the gift of financial literacy. ",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/tech/coronavirus-google-data-sharing-intl-scli/index.html,Google to release your location data to help fight coronavirus pandemic,"The company said it plans to publish a series of ""Community Mobility Reports"" to show the types of places people are visiting across 131 countries and regions. The first report was published on Friday.  Google said in a blog post it hopes tracking movement trends over time and by geography could help shape and inform governments' and public health officials' response to the coronavirus pandemic.  The reports, which contain data from two to three days earlier, intend to spot trends in how people are behaving and responding to social distancing. Broken down by country and then by region, the reports will show if people are headed to retail and grocery stores, pharmacies, parks, workplaces and more. It'll also show how busy these places were before the pandemic. The company said the findings are ""created with aggregated, anonymized sets of data from users who have turned on the location history setting, which is off by default"" in Google's services.  It added that it would not release information that could be used to identify its users, such as individual location or contacts.  ""In addition to other resources public health officials might have, we hope these reports will help support decisions about how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Google said in a blog post. ""This information could help officials understand changes in essential trips that can shape recommendations on business hours or inform delivery service offerings.""  The news comes as much of the world's population is living under restrictions and lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19, which has killed more than 54,000 people globally and sickened more than one million, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.  But Google's move to release location data highlights concerns around privacy. According to Mark Skilton, director of the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Network at Warwick Business School in the UK, Google's decision to use public data ""raises a key conflict between the need for mass surveillance to effectively combat the spread of coronavirus and the issues of confidentiality, privacy, and consent concerning any data obtained."" ""Covid-19 is an emergency on such a huge scale that, if anonymity is managed appropriately, internet giants and social media platforms could play a responsible part in helping to build collective crowd intelligence for social good, rather than profit,"" Skilton said.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/business/oil-ceos-trump-meeting/index.html,Here's what America's oil CEOs discussed with Trump ,"Trump was ""very receptive"" to that request and did not discuss government-mandated oil production cuts during the meeting at the White House, American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers, who was in the meeting, told CNN Business.   Saudi Arabia and Russia would like to get the United States, the world's leading oil producer, to join in emergency cuts aimed at halting the crash in oil prices.   ""We are operating in a market economy, not one with state-owned oil companies,"" Sommers said in an interview following the meeting with Trump and the CEOs of ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and other major oil companies.   The nosedive to 18-year lows in oil prices threatens to set off a wave of bankruptcies in the United States.   ""We had very positive conversations about ensuring this industry has the liquidity it needs to continue to survive,"" Sommers said.  Although oil executives didn't ask for ""special treatment,"" Sommers said smaller oil companies should get access to Small Business Administration loans and larger ones should be able to tap programs set up as part of the $2 trillion stimulus package enacted last week.  ""We want to make sure oil and gas companies that were solvent going into the pandemic would be able to access the same types of programs as other companies,"" Sommers said. ""The president was clear that would be the case.""  The White House declined to comment.  Market forces will cause US output to drop Trump told the oil executives during the meeting that he's optimistic that Saudi Arabia and Russia will reach a deal to end their price war that erupted early last month.  ""I think President Putin and the Crown Prince want something to happen badly,"" Trump said, according to a White House readout of the meeting. He added that he's spoken to both the Russian leader and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  OPEC+ and other countries are scheduled to meet next week via video conference to discuss how to proceed. The meeting, along with Trump's talk of major production cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia, caused US oil prices to spike by a record 32% this week.  Although there has been speculation about potential output cuts by the United States, that apparently was not on the table Friday.  ""There were no discussions of production cuts in the meeting -- outside of market mechanisms,"" Sommers said. ""We have thousands of producers in the United States. We don't have authorities within our government structure to shut in that kind of production.""  US oil output, however, will sharply decline because of the plunge to $20 a barrel -- a level far too low for many American oil companies to survive.   Leading companies including Chevron and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) have already announced sharp cuts to spending and lowered their production targets.   ""There are already production cuts happening in the United States,"" said Sommers. ""And they are going to be significant, but based entirely on the price of oil, not from a government mandate.""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/economy/minority-job-losses-coronavirus/index.html,"Early coronavirus job losses hitting minorities, women, teens particularly hard","Minority workers, teens and, in many cases, women, are losing jobs at a higher pace than other groups. ""There's no doubt about it, they're getting hit worse,"" said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic & Policy Research. ""They're working in sectors like hotels, restaurants and retail that are being harder hit.""  Minorities are also losing jobs such as custodial services as businesses close or are operating remotely.  The virus has so far resulted in 701,000 lost jobs according to the March jobs report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that doesn't even include the full impact of the nearly 10 million people who filed for jobless benefits in the last two weeks. While the unemployment rate increased to 4.4% from 3.5% in the official report, the last two weeks of unemployment benefit filings suggest that the true rate is probably about 18.3% for adults, according to William Rodgers, chief economist at the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.  He estimates the unemployment rates for minorities and teen workers is probably worse. He said the true rate is likely 20.7% percent for African Americans rather than the official rate of 4.1%, and 18.7% for Hispanic workers, as opposed to official rate of 6%. For teens, he puts the true rate at least 26.7% not the 14.3% reported by BLS. Rodgers agrees that the higher rates for minorities and young workers is primarily because the sectors in which they typically work will be more affected by current lockdown policies in much of the country.  ""Those groups' jobs were at greater risk going into this downturn,"" he said. About 30% of workers at hotels in 2019 were Hispanic, and another 19% are black, according to the BLS. Restaurants, bars and other food services, which have been particularly hard hit, had 27% of workers last year who were Hispanic, and 13% who were black.  At department stores, most of which have shut down because of the crisis, 19% of employees were black and another 19% were Hispanic. The catchall labor department category that includes temporary workers, custodial help and landscaping services lost 61,000 jobs in the official March labor report. About half of those workers are minorities. Rodgers estimates that the unemployment rate for women right now is lower than the overall unemployment rate, partly because women are well represented in the fields of nursing and primary and secondary education, which so far have been spared job cuts. But job cuts in these sectors are likely in coming months, he said, particularly since women tend to hold government jobs that could be cut as states and cities respond to budget shortfalls. Many segments where women make up a majority of workers have already seen job losses. While hospitals aren't cutting staff, for example, some 40,000 jobs have been lost in the offices of doctors and dentists and other healthcare providers. More than 70% of the workers in those offices are women.  In addition, women make up 94% of child day care services workers. That segment lost nearly 19,000 jobs in the official BLS report, and many more the more than 1 million jobs in the sector since then. ""The child care infrastructure has been decimated,"" C. Nicole Mason, CEO of Institute for Women's Policy Research, which estimates that nearly 60% of the 700,000 job losses in the March report were held by women. She said women have a majority of jobs in many segments of the service sector that are at extreme risk in the current downturn. ""What we see now is a service sector recession that is disproportionately impacting women,"" she said.",4/4/2020

As an example of the drop in traffic he said that on March 28, Delta carried only 38,000 customers, versus its normal late-March Saturday of traffic of 600,000. ""I wish I could predict this would end soon, but the reality is we simply don't know how long it will take before the virus is contained and customers are ready to fly again,"" he said. Airline fan Buffett dumping shares In a separate filing Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), disclosed that it sold 18% of its stake in Delta (DAL) earlier this week, dumping nearly 13 million shares for $314 million.  Berkshire also disclosed it had sold 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV) for $74 million. That only represented 4% of Berkshire's Southwest holdings though. Berkshire and its chairman Warren Buffett have been major investors in a number of airlines in recent years. It previously held 11% of Delta's shares, and 10.3% of Southwest before the recent sales, along with 10% of American (AAL) and 9% of United (UAL).  Berkshire is among the three largest shareholders of all four airlines. Buffett typically does not sell shares simply due to a decline in price or difficult economic times. Other airlines also see tough times ahead Delta wasn't the only airline issuing a grim outlook for business Friday evening. United and JetBlue did as well. United said that its average revenue in March was $100 million a day less than a year ago. It also cut April capacity by 80%, and said that it still only expected to fill a small portion of the seats it flies - a percentage between the low teens and single digits. United filled 84% of its seats with paying customers throughout 2019. An airline typically needs to sell at least two-thirds of the available seats on a flight in order for it to be profitable. United said because of the low traffic it expects to make even deeper cuts in the May schedule and it will continue to cut the schedule until it sees signs of a recovery in demand. But it's not expecting any significant rebound soon. It said revenue for the last three months of this year is still expected to be down 30% from the final quarter of 2019. JetBlue said that it expects to fly only 7,000 customers a day in April and possibly in May, compared to the normal 120,000 it would handle. It said it was taking in just $1 million a day in bookings and ancillary fees, down from $22 million during April last year. And it is issuing $11 million per day of travel bank credits for canceled bookings. Airlines file for help Bastian confirmed that Delta filed Friday for its share of $25 billion in federal grants for the airline industry approved by Congress last week. Most other airlines confirmed that they, too, filed or planned to file for such support. Airlines that did not file by Friday stood the risk that there would not be money available to them when they did. There's another $25 billion in loan support available as part of the package. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker told his employees a week ago that American stood to get  $12 billion of the $50 billion of help available because of it is the world's largest airline.  United, Southwest, JetBlue (JBLU) and Hawaiian airlines disclosed their requests for help in statements or company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sun County, Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Alaska (ALK) and Allegiant Airlines (ALGT) told CNN on that they had filed.   The small regional airlines that operate as feeders for the major carriers also all filed for help, according to Faye Malarkey Black, the CEO of the Regional Airline Association. That does not include the two regional airlines that already announced plans to go out of business. ",4/4/2020

In late March, Amazon donated $25 million in a relief fund for Amazon employees and partners. But it confused and angered people that the fund's page allows for public donations. Amazon later amended the website to say, ""While we aren't expecting anyone to do so, you can make a voluntary donation to the fund if you desire to do so."" Amazon noted that it was required to solicit public donations to set up the relief fund. ""The structure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way,"" Amazon told CNN Business in a statement on March 24. In February, the tech billionaire pledged $10 billion to fight climate change, after Amazon employees pressured him and the company publicly.",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/tech/location-tracking-florida-coronavirus/index.html,How the cell phones of spring breakers who flouted coronavirus warnings were tracked,"X-Mode and Tectonix focused on a high-profile case: tracking location data from the phones of people who visited the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in March -- among them spring breakers who made national news two weeks ago when they ignored warnings to practice social distancing despite the worsening coronavirus pandemic.  The results of tracking data, a map posted on Twitter, showed where people went after they visited the beach, spreading out all across the country to major cities including New York and Chicago, possibly bringing the coronavirus with them. X-Mode says it provides location tracking services to app makers for the likes of weather and transit apps. The locations of spring breakers and others with those apps on their phones could have been tracked. X-Mode says the data it collects through apps and then provides to advertisers and other companies is anonymized, meaning it does not match individuals to the devices it tracks. The company did not provide the names of the apps their technology is embedded in.   ""We wanted to showcase the impact of what happens when you don't exercise social distancing and essentially how small our community is,"" Josh Anton, X-Mode's CEO, told CNN Business on Tuesday. ""Our community's very connected."" The map generated from X-Mode's data by Tectonix, a data visualization firm, is indeed powerful and underlines why the US government might be considering using location data from Americans' cell phones to try to track and possibly curtail the spread of the coronavirus.  It also may point to a potential sea change in how some in the tech industry talk about the data they possess. Silicon Valley has endured years of high-profile data privacy scandals. But now smaller companies like X-Mode, unheard of unknown by the majority of Americans, are publicly touting demonstrations of their technology — suggesting businesses like theirs see the potential of helping track the spread of the coronavirus as an opportunity to show how their often maligned data can be used for good. Cuebiq, another location tracking company, has been similarly public about its abilities. Across the globe governments are weighing the need to contain the virus against citizens' privacy, with privacy losing in some cases. Israel last month deployed spy technology to track coronavirus patients and the people they may have come in contact with. And authorities in Moscow are using the city's vast system of 170,000 surveillance camera with facial recognition technology to catch and fine people violating quarantine and self-isolation rules. Facebook and Google confirmed to CNN Business in March that they were exploring ways to use aggregated, anonymized data to help in the US coronavirus effort. The location data conversations were part of a series of interactions between the White House and the tech industry about how Silicon Valley could can contribute to the response to the pandemic. The potential embrace of such technologies by the US government is leaving privacy advocates feeling uneasy. David Carroll, an associate professor at The New School in New York and a privacy campaigner who has worked for years exposing Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal, warned the coronavirus  pandemic could be used as a way to undermine American civil liberties. ""Pandemics offer an urgent justification to surrender to surveillance that informs response efforts. But privacy protections, especially related to health data, are among the first to be rescinded in this type of emergency,"" Carroll told CNN Business on Wednesday.  ""Beyond taking pains to exploit our location data responsibly and temporarily, we need to ensure that when we return to normal, we do the work of dismantling the pandemic panopticon and finish overdue reform in the United States, which includes improving how we enforce fundamental data protection rights around the world,"" he added. ""Otherwise pandemic-level surveillance capabilities will surely be abused."" Location tracking, like what X-Mode does, is not out of the ordinary in the technology industry, but normalizing it could incentivize exploitation of such capabilities. Anton says X-Mode does not match people's identities to the devices it tracks and that the company complies with European and Californian privacy laws, both Europe and California have implemented new data privacy laws in recent years.  But as an investigation by The New York Times found in 2018, anonymization of data does not always guarantee individuals cannot be identified.  Anton said his company would be willing to assist the US government if it could help save lives — pointing to how the company's data was previously used in a study aimed at improving how ambulances are dispatched after a disaster.  The CEO said he believes any tracking tool built for this purpose should ask for the consent of the people being tracked. ""People will willingly consent for something like that if it means saving their lives,"" he said, ""people they know, or people they don't.""",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/business/3m-defense-production-act-response/index.html,3M: We'll make more N95 masks for the US but we need to keep exporting them ,"A day after Trump invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) to order 3M to significantly ramp up production of N95 respirators, 3M said in a statement that ""3M and its employees have gone above and beyond to manufacture as many N95 respirators as possible for the US market."" The DPA also requires 3M to prioritize its respirator orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The company said it was already working closely with the administration to supply more masks to FEMA while increasing its mask imports into the United States from its global manufacturing facilities, including from China. 3M, however, took issue with the administration's additional request that 3M  (MMM)cease exporting made-in-the-USA respirators to Canada and to Latin America. ""There are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,"" the statement said, adding that such a move would ""likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same."" 3M warned the end result could lead to the net number of respirators being made available to the United States to decrease.  ""That is the opposite of what we and the administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek,"" the company said. Price gouging and counterfeits Leading N95 mask manufacturers have issued fraud and price gouging warnings amid the coronavirus pandemic. 3M said that while it hasn't seen a large influx of counterfeit respirators in the market, it is tracking a bigger issue of fraudsters trying to collect money in exchange for masks they don't actually have. Regarding price gouging, 3M said it is working with the U.S. Attorney General William Barr and attorneys general of every state, to curb the problem and to inform them that 3M hasn't, and will not, has not raise prices for its respirators.",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/tech/f1-teams-coronavirus/index.html,"F1 teams are lightning fast, highly skilled and available. Here's how they're fighting coronavirus","Built for speed, and with engineering expertise to spare, the racing teams are proving to be powerful weapons in the fight against coronavirus.  Seven teams including Aston Martin Red Bull, McLaren, ROKiT Williams and Mercedes-AMG Petronas have joined a manufacturing consortium that aims to ramp up production of ventilators to 1,500 units a week.  The group, which includes industrial giants such as Siemens (SIEGY), Airbus (EADSF) and BAE Systems (BAESF), says its members have already received orders from the government for over 10,000 of the devices.  Their contribution would be welcomed by a government that has only 8,000 ventilators on hand, and that has faced withering criticism over its coronavirus communication and testing strategies. There have been than 38,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United Kingdom and over 3,600 deaths.  With the start of the racing season delayed by the pandemic, and eight contests either canceled or postponed, F1 teams are jumping into the effort.  James White, a spokesperson for the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium, said the racing teams are perfectly suited to the mission. ""F1 teams are used to operating under intense time pressures, which is clearly what we are doing right now,"" he said.  UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has himself tested positive for coronavirus, touted the success of the consortium on Friday, boasting during a radio interview that the group has already produced 560 ventilators. Tim Bampton, communications director at McLaren, said ""the speed at which it came together was phenomenal."" With industrial giants bringing ""scale and medical expertise"" to the consortium, he said the F1 teams can focus on what they do best: moving very quickly. In their normal work, everything the teams do is geared around innovation and urgency, he said. ""We develop cars for every race"" and use ""rapid prototype systems"" that rely on a global network of ""100 different suppliers who are used to dealing with us, used to our fast pace,"" added Brampton. And while the public rarely gets a look behind the scenes, the teams' logistical and back office operations are extremely sophisticated. ""Planning, program management, purchasing, procurement and machine shop"" are all honed for speed, Bampton said. Bampton said the teams, normally fierce competitors, are now acting as one. His engineers will be overhauling their machine shop to make components for ventilators, as well as ""designing and building end of [production] line test equipment."" Another task: producing trolleys that can move ventilators to patients in need. Breathing aids and missteps F1 engine manufacturer Mercedes has meanwhile teamed up with clinicians and university engineers in London to design a breathing aid for coronavirus patients. The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices could help buy hospitals more time until more ventilators can be produced. CPAP devices, which push air and oxygen into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate, have been used in hospitals in China and Italy to treat coronavirus infections, with reports indicating that roughly half of such patients have avoided the need for ventilators.  Following clinical trials, Mercedes and other F1 teams could produce up to 1,000 per day. Yet the UK efforts to bring private industry into the fight against coronavirus have suffered some false starts. Gtech, a British manufacturer of vacuum cleaners, was asked by the government to come up with a ventilator design. The company quickly came up with the required schematics, and was ready to start production when the government changed tack and said it needed a different type of device.  ""I was asked: could we produce up to 30,000 in two weeks?"" Gtech founder Nick Grey told CNN Business last week. ""I put together a design that we could ... go into mass production in 24 hours notice."" But the government never gave its go ahead. ""What became apparent over the following week was that people needed a different kind of ventilator,"" Grey said. The Gtech design mimicked human breath by compressing a rubber bag; instead, Grey said the government belatedly realized it needed CPAP devices similar to the ones designed by Mercedes.  When asked about this discrepancy, a spokesperson for the UK government directed CNN Business to a statement, which said in part that the government was ""currently working with expert clinicians and health regulators to test all new machine designs, as patient safety is of paramount importance."" Testing kits next? Hancock, the health secretary, doubled down on his enthusiasm for the ventilator consortium on Friday, saying the same strategy could be applied to manufacturing coronavirus test kits.  ""People will throw their rocks and make their criticisms,"" he told BBC Radio. ""What we are trying to do leading the nation through this is work out every single moment, what is the best we can do, and if people come forward with ideas we haven't thought of great.""",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/tech/coronavirus-tracing-app-uk-europe/index.html,Can you use apps to track coronavirus and protect privacy? Europe's going to try,"While the apps will be optional, developers and policymakers hope the region's strict data laws will encourage widespread adoption by members of the public and help prevent a new wave of cases once lockdowns are lifted. Singapore has already successfully launched such an app. It notifies users via bluetooth connection if they have been in the vicinity of someone who has tested positive for the virus.  But Singapore has fewer privacy protections in place — though the government says the information on the app is encrypted and deleted after 21 days. China has utilized similar tracking apps or apps monitoring people in quarantine, which mark down their exact locations and information, all of which is shared with authorities. Across Europe, developers and medical experts are looking to launch opt-in apps that they say will help health officials stem the spread of the virus while protecting personal privacy.  The United Kingdom's National Health Service told CNN it is ""looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organization to do this as rapidly as possible."" Experts at Oxford University are helping the NHS develop the app. Professor Christophe Fraser from Oxford University's Big Data Institute, said in a statement the app would control transmission rates even more effectively than the social distancing rules currently in place.  ""Our analysis suggests that about half of transmissions occur in the early phase of the infection, before you show any symptoms of infection,"" Fraser said. ""Traditional public health contact tracing approaches provide incomplete data and cannot keep up with the pace of this pandemic."" Sky News reported on Tuesday that the app could launch after the UK lockdown has lifted, on a voluntary basis.  The German government is also exploring the use of digital technology, such as a contact tracking app, to help break the chain of infection. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would be prepared to use one herself.  ''It's clear that it would be on a voluntary basis, but if the testing of these apps shows them to be good... I would certainly be in favor of recommending this to citizens,"" Merkel told reporters.         How apps track the virus Here's how the smartphone app would work. Using bluetooth, it establishes a list of devices that have been in close contact with each other for a pre-defined period of time set by the country's health officials, such as 10 or 15 minutes. (Walking by someone on the street would not count as a connection).  If a person is subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus, they note that in the app and their status is verified by a health professional. The app then notifies all the connections listed in the patient's device, giving them the chance to self isolate or get tested. A group of 130 researchers, developers and scientific experts calling themselves the Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), are volunteering their time to develop the backbone of an app that would be open for any country to use. By using the same backend technology, national apps could connect across borders to further strengthen contact tracing, while observing strict European data protection rules.  Christian Boos, founder of German technology firm Arago, told CNN Business that for such apps to be successful, they need a large data set. That means 60% adoption and the ability to work across borders.  ""We are providing this backbone in a trustworthy and well controlled, certified way,"" said Boos, who is helping to lead the initiative. The German data protection agency is advising the team on this project, he added. The app is already being tested in an army barracks in Berlin and should be ready for launch on April 7, Boos said. The team has been working with several governments, with the aim of having every European country incorporate it into their health systems.  Keeping it private Boos said the European version will anonymize user data and the smartphone's identifying information. If you test positive for Covid-19, your contacts won't know that it's you, only that they have been in sustained contact with someone who tested positive. Unless you choose to identify yourself, that is, perhaps at the request of a health care professional. And rather than hindering adoption, Europe's sweeping data privacy and processing rules under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in place since 2018, could help.  ""GDPR has a clause excepting work in the overwhelming public interest. No one should constrain work on responding to coronavirus due to data protection law,"" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has recovered from the virus, tweeted last month. ""We are all having to give up some of our liberties; rights under GDPR have always been balanced against other public interests."" Subhajit Basu, professor in Information Technology Law at the University of Leeds, said GDPR could encourage people to opt in because the legislation promises transparency in how and where your data is being processed, if not total privacy.  ""It will give people the confidence that now we have a robust legal framework in place so whenever government chooses, even if it is a Chinese-style individual level location tracking of people, it will comply with the law, within GDPR,"" Basu told CNN Business. But Basu warned that because of the GDPR caveat allowing data processing without the user's explicit consent in an emergency situation, governments would need to be ""much more transparent and ensure this data is kept securely.""  ""When you are facing a situation like this, it is critical that we trust our government that people trust the steps our government takes and protection of privacy is critical for that trust,"" he said. ""If our government takes disproportionate measures it will undermine our trust, it will not work, people will not download the app and won't update it."" — Nadine Schmidt in Berlin contributed to this article.",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/media/photojournalists-coronavirus/index.html,Photojournalists are risking their lives to capture the pandemic ,"""Even though the reporters are working from home, photographers can't work from home,"" Gomez said in the video posted to Facebook on April 1. ""We, my team, is working out there, to report the community everything that is happening now, risking their lives, literally, so be kind with them when you see them out there."" Newsrooms across the US have closed their offices in the wake of coronavirus outbreak to create the social distancing needed to slow the spread of the deadly illness. But while many journalists can do their jobs remotely — through phone calls, video calls and Slack messages — photographers continue to put themselves in harm's way to capture the pandemic from the front lines.  Last month, freelance photographer Whitney Curtis went inside the home of two medical professionals for a Washington Post story about health care workers who are fearful of infecting their families. Curtis told CNN Business that she used hand sanitizer and put on an N95 mask before entering their home. She called to be let in, instead of knocking on the door. She washed her hands again once she was inside. She brought with her limited equipment — just a belt pack around her waist — and didn't set anything down on the ground or other surfaces. When she got home, she changed her clothes, disinfected her gear and took a shower.  ""My biggest fear is I'm an asymptomatic carrier of the virus,"" Curtis said. ""That's the difficult thing with this story. Photojournalists, we're used to putting ourselves in precarious and potentially harmful situations, but in those situations, we're the ones at risk. We're not putting other ones at risk."" John Moore, special correspondent for Getty Images, traveled to Seattle in early March for his first assignment covering the impact of coronavirus. He photographed the empty streets and visited the Life Care Nursing Home in Kirkland, Washington — the epicenter of Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. At least 35 deaths are associated with the facility, according to officials.  A week later, Moore flew back to New York and began to document life in suburbs such as Westchester County, Long Island and Stamford, Connecticut, where he is based.  ""Like many of us, I have photographed at drive-through testing centers, but I've also tried to concentrate on families who are isolated at home,"" Moore said. ""I photographed two undocumented families from Honduras who rented a house together in Long Island. One person in the group came down sick and the rest quickly followed and then self-isolated at home for two weeks.""  When photographing the sick families, Moore said he wore a Tyvek suit, boot covers, two layers of latex gloves and a full face respirator.  ""I had spoken with one of them ahead of time, so they would know what to expect and not be so taken aback when I showed up at the front door looking like I was wearing a space suit,"" Moore said. This week, Moore went on ride-alongs with EMT units wearing an N95 mask, gloves and an apron.  Benjamin Norman, a New York-based freelance photographer, was in Florida last month to cover the annual golf tournament, The Players Championship. But when that got canceled, he flew back to New York and began covering the pandemic's effects on the city.  ""I'm just as scared as everybody else,"" Norman said. ""The only way I've continued with this job is because this landed in my backyard. I'm local. I pride myself in being a local photojournalist and all of a sudden this happened in my backyard."" For the New York Times, Norman has photographed the city's empty streets. For Time magazine, he went inside Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn where he captured health care workers on the job. Inside the emergency room, he said he took the same precautions as the doctors and nurses, wearing a mask, gloves and goggles. He said he practiced ""extreme social distancing"" and did not put his gear down on any surface. ""Reporters have been doing such a good job of getting the data and the scale of this thing. Now it's the job of photojournalists to put a face to the data,"" Norman said. ""To me, that's in a hospital where people are in literal life or death moments."" Paul Gillespie, photographer at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, said covering the pandemic reminded him a bit of photographing the aftermath of 9/11. But an even more comparable experience was working during the DC sniper attacks in October 2002, when two domestic terrorists killed 10 people over three weeks. ""You can get this virus anywhere just like the sniper could shoot you anywhere,"" Gillespie said.  But despite the fear, Gillespie has been documenting the pandemic for his local paper, where he's worked for almost 20 years. When he doesn't have a specific assignment, he drives around looking for moments to capture. Last week, he spotted stuffed animals lined up along fences and was told the neighborhood was having a ""safari"" for the children.  In February, Associated Press photojournalist Ted Warren took photos of sports games, a Bernie Sanders rally, Boeing airplanes and a new Amazon grocery store. But since March, his sole focus has been on the coronavirus. Warren said his first coronavirus assignment was a January 22 press conference with Washington state health officials about the response to the first case in the US. He took photos of medical personnel inside a hospital in Everett, Washington, the next day.  ""As I covered the Seattle Sounders home opener on March 1 — with a particular emphasis on the stadium's new hand sanitizing stations — the COVID-19 story broke wide open, and coronavirus has been nearly 100% of what I've done since,"" Warren said.  ""I think my first non-virus assignment is scheduled for Sunday or next week,"" Warren added.  As Warren continues to document the pandemic, he said he is looking forward to taking photos when social distancing restrictions are lifted.  ""Hugging people, shaking hands, playing city-park baseball and enjoying normal and healthy life again,"" Warren said. ""That's going to be a great day."" The Statesman's executive editor John Bridges issued a statement to CNN Business on Friday to express his gratitude to Gomez and the journalists and photographers covering the pandemic.  ""Many people don't appreciate the dangers that journalists, especially photographers, often face in trying to tell the story or capture the moment,"" he said. ""That's especially true when the danger is an invisible one. We likely will never know where Lola came to be infected by the virus, whether it was while doing her job or just in the routine course of everyday life. Regardless, her commitment to documenting the crisis in Austin — and the commitment of journalists and photographers everywhere — deserves our appreciation and thanks."" Also on Friday, the Statesman published Gomez's first-person account of the days leading up to her illness. She said she had to dictate her story to a colleague from her hospital bed. ""I wanted to share my story as a journalist and a human to show no one is exempt from this,"" she said. ""If they don't believe the news, they should at least believe the people who are telling their own stories of suffering with this vicious illness.""",4/4/2020

""We want to encourage customers to bring the fewest number of people per family necessary to shop."" No more than five customers are allowed per 1,000 square feet in the store at any given time, the retail giant announced in the blog post.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/success/equal-pay-day-women-paid-less-men/index.html,What happened when these women found out what their male colleagues made,"Among all full-time workers, the average woman made about 80 cents for every dollar a man made in 2017, according to the latest Census Bureau data. The gap is even wider for black and Hispanic women. But, in some industries, the gap narrows when comparing the pay of male and female workers who have the same education level, experience and job tenure.   While more companies are being transparent about their pay, it can be a real gut punch to find out a male colleague with similar or even less experience is making more for the same role. Here's what these women did when they found out. I was told 'You're single without kids' It's been 30 years since Emily Lawrence found out she was making a lot less than her male colleague, but she's still shocked by her boss's reasoning.  She was working as a budget analyst for a congressional committee in Washington, DC at her first real job out of college in 1988.  She was making $19,000 a year. ""It was the time in my life I was making the least amount of money, but having the most fun,"" she recalled.   But when the committee staff's salaries was made public, Lawrence saw she was earning less than half the amount one of her male colleagues was making. While he had a bit more experience, Lawrence's boss was often asking her to redo the male colleague's work.  She marched into her boss's office with ""the brashness only a 22-year-old could muster"" wanting to know why she was making so much less.  According to Lawrence, this is what her female boss told her: The male colleague had a wife and family to support, while Lawrence was single.  ""I was stunned,"" she recalled.  Lawrence responded that her personal life shouldn't play a role in determining her compensation. A few months later, she got a 50% raise.  ""I've never not negotiated a salary since then,"" said Lawrence, who is currently an in-house attorney for a global manufacturing company. ""Do your salary research, and if you get an offer from a company, negotiate. As long as you do it intelligently and respectfully, they aren't going to hold that against you."" I was barely making more than the intern  Olivia Jaras has made a career out of teaching women to negotiate compensation and get what they deserve. It's a passion that comes from firsthand experience. In 2011, Jaras started working at a financial institution. She was a contractor, and one of her responsibilities was running payroll for international employees.  The hours were long and the work was intense, but it was a great opportunity. Eventually, they brought in an intern to help her with projects. He was an undergrad making $2,500 a month. Jaras was making $2,800 a month. At the time, she had her MBA and was working on getting her masters in Latin American economic development.  ""I was fuming, I was so mad when I found out."" So she started strategizing: She read some books, did her research and had a plan on how to ask her boss for a raise. It didn't go well.  She opened her case noting that she was only making $300 more than the intern.  ""He looked at me very puzzled and started getting red and I could tell something wasn't sitting right with him. He got so pissed off,"" Jaras recalled.  He kicked her out of his office telling her she should be thankful to still have a job and to never come back with an emotional justification on how she should be valued more.  ""I went back into my corner, and put my head down and kept working."" But she was demoralized, and started to disengage in her work in the following months. ""I thought maybe it's time to go home and have kids. I was done with this environment.""  Jaras ended up leaving the job about a year later and relocated to New Hampshire where she later accepted a job after negotiating everything she wanted.   Jaras now runs Salary Coaching for Women, which helps women negotiate for better pay.  ""I did what most women do wrong when they go to negotiate. I went in with my emotions on my sleeve. If I had just scrapped my emotions and brought it all down to quantifiable evidence with what I was worth in the market and how my job had changed over time ... it would have been a very different conversation."" The men I trained were making more than me  Elisabeth Trueblood was working as a night auditor for a local hotel when the company hired three male employees. Trueblood, who was attending college at the time, helped train the new hires. One eventually confided to her that he made 50 cents more an hour, plus 25 cents extra an hour for working the late shift.  ""It was frustrating,"" recalled Trueblood, now 27. She asked for a raise and was told that the next time the company gave out raises she could negotiate for more. She was, however, given the additional pay for working the late shift.  Trueblood has learned from the experience. She recently negotiated her pay before accepting a new position, and has more than doubled her salary since graduating. The experience was also partly why she decided to pursue a career in human resources. She estimates she's hired more than 500 people, and says it's ""super rare"" when a woman negotiates. ""I would say 90% of women don't negotiate. When men get a 'no' on pay, they ask for what else the company can do for them, like more PTO or Fridays off."" I learned early on that I need to negotiate  Melinda Garcia was doing well at her first job at a digital marketing agency in Boston. She had been promoted twice and her salary increased more than 30% from $28,000 to $37,500 in almost two years.  When she got promoted to account manager, she accepted without negotiating. A few months later, the company hired two men for the same position. While they were all waiting for training one day, one of the new hires casually complained about how little the position paid. He was making $45,000.  Garcia was in shock. She had more experience and had been at the company longer.  ""He didn't have any experience whatsoever, it was his first corporate job and he was offered almost $10,000 more than me,"" she said. ""I was so upset and felt taken advantage of.""  Armed with this new information she went into her boss's office the next day and asked for a raise. Her boss seemed caught off guard by the request, Garcia recalled.  ""She was instantly confused asking where this was coming from."" Garcia didn't divulge that she knew her male colleague's salary, and made her case based on her merits: Her increased workload and the value she brought to the company. Her manager offered her a raise to $45,000, which was soon increased to $50,000 for exceeding sales targets.  Garcia, 28, is now making more than double the raise she was seeking, and is currently working at Fairygodboss.  ""When asking for more money, you should have receipts. Don't walk in blindly, show what you have done,"" she said.  ",4/4/2020

""We kept hearing cries for (personal protective equipment) from our community and wanted to help,"" Clara Tsai told CNN in an interview. The state will allocate the second shipment but ""it's our intention to help the most underserved institutions."" She cited Jacobi Medical Center and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, and Elmhurst Hospital in Queens as the institutions she and her husband thought might need the supplies the most. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo referenced the donations during a daily coronavirus briefing. ""I want to thank Joe Tsai, and Clara Tsai, and Jack Ma from Alibaba,"" said Cuomo, during a Saturday briefing. ""This is a big deal and it's going to make a significant difference for us."" Hospitals in New York and across the country have been scrambling to find enough ventilators, masks and other protective gear needed for healthcare workers to battle the virus, which has killed about 60,000 people worldwide. The Tsais have considerable ties to the New York community. Joe Tsai, a Canadian Taiwanese businessman and philanthropist, owns the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and Brooklyn's Barclays Center arena. His co-founder, Jack Ma, made a separate donation of masks and testing kits in March. Clara Tsai runs a charitable organization, the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation, which oversees causes including economic mobility in Brooklyn. The Tsais worked with the Greater New York Hospital Association to distribute the items in their first shipment. It contained 300,000 surgical masks that went toward 11 New York City-area nursing homes, 70,000 medical goggles donated to 11 New York City-area nursing homes and Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and 1000 ventilators that were donated to the Mount Sinai hospital system. The Tsais are letting the state handle the allocation of the second shipment after hearing Governor Cuomo announce that the state would be centralizing resource allocation. The shipment on Saturday contains 1 million surgical masks and 1.3 million KN95 masks, 100,000 medical goggles and 1000 ventilators.  KN95 is a mask produced in China that is similar in name as the N95, which is considered the gold standard of respirator masks as it filters out at least 95% of very small particles from the air. The US Food and Drug Administration cleared KN95 masks for use on Friday as long as certain criteria is met, including evidence demonstrating that the mask is authentic.",4/4/2020

The meeting, which was called by Saudi Arabia, comes after President Donald Trump suggested that massive production cuts could be on the way and Saudi Arabia called for an ""urgent"" effort to restore ""balance"" to the oil market.  Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in an epic price war since early March when the OPEC+ oil alliance cracked, flooding the oil market with cheap crude just as demand craters because of the coronavirus pandemic. Crude has crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks. The meeting will be held via video conference and will include oil producers from outside the OPEC+ alliance that includes Russia and a few other countries, two senior sources at the OPEC secretariat told CNN Business. The final list of invitees has not yet been set, they said. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico could be invited, according to reports Trump, who met on Friday at the White House with US oil executives, said he's optimistic that Saudi Arabia and Russia will reach a deal to end their price war that erupted early last month.  ""I think President Putin and the crown prince want something to happen badly,"" Trump said, according to a White House readout of the meeting, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He added that he's spoken to both the Russian leader and Prince bin Salman.  Both Saudi Arabia and Russia would like to get the United States, the world's leading oil producer, to join in emergency cuts aimed at halting the crash in oil prices.   American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers, who was in the meeting, told CNN Business that possibility was not discussed.  The official Saudi Press Agency on Saturday said Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud ""is still welcoming to anyone who wants to find solutions to the challenges of the oil market."" US oil prices soared 25% — their biggest one-day gain on record — on Thursday after Trump tweeted that he hopes and expects Saudi Arabia and Russia will slash output by between 10 million and 15 million barrels per day.  Prices continued to advance Friday, recovering some of the massive plunge seen over the past month. ",4/4/2020

""Jungle Cruise,"" the studio's adventure film based on its beloved theme park ride, has been moved from July 24 of this year to July 30, 2021. ""Artemis Fowl"" is moving from a theatrical release on May 29 to a release on the company's streaming service, Disney+. Disney and Pixar's ""Onward"" was released on Disney+ Friday. Disney's (DIS) rescheduled film lineup has caused a ripple effect across this year and next. With ""Black Widow"" moving to November, Marvel's other big film of 2020, ""Eternals"" is now moving to February 12 of next year.  Since Marvel has a connected cinematic universe, its time line will now shift. Next year's ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" are all being pushed back.  The shifts in dates indicate that Disney is still committed to theatrical releases for its films rather than putting them out for at home rental and purchases. Disney announced last month that it would release Pixar's ""Onward"" on demand and on Disney+ early because of the coronavirus outbreak. The company put ""Frozen 2"" on Disney+ early as well.  Disney has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Its theme parks have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been put on hold.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/economy/europe-job-losses-relief/index.html,Millions of Europeans are losing their jobs. The EU wants to raise €100 billion to help,"The European Commission on Thursday proposed a new €100 billion ($109 billion) relief initiative that will provide loans to member states who need funds to support jobs. The Commission plans to use the European Union's strong credit rating to tap financial markets and then lend the funds cheaply to member states. The program is meant to encourage companies to reduce employees' hours instead of laying them off completely, a model used in Germany. Workers would receive compensation for hours not worked. ""In this coronavirus crisis, only the strongest of responses will do,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. ""Every available euro in the EU budget will be redirected to address it."" The loans would be guaranteed by member states and ""directed to where they are most urgently needed,"" according to the Commission. The measure still requires approval from the bloc's 27 members. EU countries have committed huge sums of money in recent days to supporting business and workers though the deep recession that is unfolding, and EU limits on budget deficits have been relaxed to allow them to borrow more. The European Central Bank has also promised to pump hundreds of billions of euros into markets this year to prevent the shock triggering a new financial crisis. But the bloc is deeply divided over whether to issue debt, dubbed corona bonds, to raise long-term financing for all member states to help pay for measures to cope with the pandemic and support economic recovery once it has passed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, backed by the leaders of Austria and the Netherlands, has opposed doing so. There are particular concerns about Italy, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic and already has significant debt.  The European Union could be forced to take additional action soon. The bloc's finance ministers are scheduled to meet by video conference on Tuesday. EU leaders could convene again later in the week. Europe's largest economy, Germany, is likely to shrink more this year than it did during the global financial crisis, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said Thursday. Meanwhile, the jobless numbers are rising fast. In Spain, unemployment in March rose by 302,265 people to 3.5 million, the largest increase on record, the country said Thursday.  The number of French employees on partial unemployment support has reached 4 million and is ""strongly increasing,"" Labor Minister Muriel Pénicaud said Thursday. The United Kingdom, which left the European Union earlier this year, said the number of people claiming universal credit welfare benefits rose to 950,000 during the last two weeks of March.  — Nadine Schmidt, Barbara Wojazer, Mark Thompson, Max Ramsay, Tim Lister, Al Goodman and Ingrid Formanek contributed reporting.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/media/movie-box-office-coronavirus/index.html,"The coronavirus won't end moviegoing, but it could change it","Now, just three months into 2020, the film industry's year may be over. The coronavirus pandemic has brought Hollywood to a complete halt. Movie theaters, big and small, have shuttered around the world, productions have stopped and the release of some of the year's biggest films have been delayed. The future of moviegoing is in serious doubt, since nobody knows how long the virus will keep things closed or how audiences will react once life does return to normal. Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, believes that theaters will ultimately rebound from the coronavirus outbreak, but it won't come without ""great losses.""  ""The industry is morphing before our very eyes and the old Hollywood adage, 'nobody knows anything,' is more relevant today than ever before,"" Bock told CNN Business. ""My guess is that blockbuster movies will have their day in the sun again. But the build-up to their dominance in the marketplace will take time; certainly a year, at minimum, to return to the form we recognize."" Bock added that while some smaller theaters will likely close indefinitely, even the ones that do return ""may find it more difficult to operate in the weeks and months following the crisis.""  It's easy to understand why the pandemic presents major challenges to theaters. Going to the movies is a communal experience where a group of strangers sit next to one another in a dark room for an extended period of time. Even if theaters are reopened, it may be awhile before audiences feel safe enough to go back to the movies. So while moviegoing may survive the pandemic in the long run, its near future — the rest of this year — is another story entirely. With the global box office paralyzed, the spring has been wiped clean of hit films such as Disney's ""Mulan"" and MGM's James Bond flick, ""No Time to Die."" Both films have been delayed, with ""No Time to Die"" moving to November and ""Mulan"" being pushed back to an unknown date.  The summer, which is arguably Hollywood's most lucrative season, also lost potential blockbusters such as Marvel Studio's ""Black Widow,"" which was pushed back to an unknown date, as well as Universal's ""F9"" and Sony's ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife,"" which were both postponed until next year. Sure, there are still potential hits on the docket for the rest of 2020. Paramount's ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is still set for June, Warner Bros.' ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was pushed back from June to August, and Mavel Studio's ""Eternals"" is still on for November. However, those films can't be released in theaters if none are open. ""It depends on the speed and success rate of our society's sustained response to the virus,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business about the potential of the movie theater industry getting back to business this year.  Robbins said that late summer seems like a ""hopeful target for the time being,"" but that ""could change on a dime depending on how this plays out.""  ""We're all playing the collective waiting game,"" he said. However, studios aren't waiting to release films to audiences. Major studios have made current films available for purchase at home — a decision that circumvented the established theatrical window, which keeps films exclusive to theaters for a few months. Universal is planning to release its latest film, ""Trolls World Tour,"" on April 10, the day it was to open in theaters. Releasing films on demand appears to be less of an industry-wide shift in how studios do business and more of a temporary solution during an unprecedented situation. Yet, the pandemic could accelerate trends that have been shaping the film business in recent years. ""This pandemic will be transformative for many businesses in ways we can only speculate. That goes for the movies too."" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business.  Dergarabedian noted it's still unknown if this crisis ends up changing the theatrical window, but that he expects to see theaters upscaling the customer experience in a major way. ""That could mean more curated content, having better food and loyalty programs and other things that help craft an exclusive experience audiences can't get at home,"" he said. Despite the challenges that the theater industry is facing, Degarabedian doesn't believe that going to the movies is going to become a relic of the past. ""Going to the movies is baked into our collective DNA, and I'm certain it will make a comeback once movie fans feel confident and safe venturing back into public spaces,"" he said. ""We simply don't know when that day will arrive.""",4/3/2020

Prices continued to advance Friday, recovering some of the massive plunge seen over the past month. Brent crude futures, the world's benchmark, were trading more than 9% higher at $32.77 a barrel. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in an epic price war since early March when the OPEC+ alliance cracked, flooding the oil market with cheap crude just as demand craters because of the coronavirus pandemic. Crude had crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks. Russia and Saudi Arabia started the feud when the coronavirus was thought to be a ""brief health scare,"" Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp said in a note. Now that it is morphing into one of the most severe hits to the economy since the Great Depression, ""there's going to be a change of heart,"" he added.  While news of the meeting will support oil prices, likely averting a slide to single-digits and easing the huge pressure on storage facilities, ""whatever cuts are agreed will not be sufficient to address the near/medium term oversupply,"" Innes said.   Will American producers cut? Analysts have expressed skepticism that Saudi Arabia and Russia would suddenly reverse course and slash production by nearly as much as Trump suggested, particularly as big cuts by Russia would undermine its goal of drowning high-cost US shale producers in a sea of cheap oil. Even 10 million barrels, the low end of Trump's touted production cuts, amounts to virtually all of Saudi Arabia's output, according to Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's biggest producer by far and has been doing much of the heavy lifting to curtail supply since the group began limiting production in 2017. Now it seems it wants others to help out.  A source within the OPEC+ alliance told CNN Business that it is unfair for two or three producers to shoulder most of the responsibility. ""We need to see burden sharing,"" the person said. Previous cuts by OPEC and its allies have given US shale producers room to capture market share. The United States recently surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer.  But there are signs that American producers could now get on board with a global effort to rescue prices.  ""While we normally compete, we agreed that #COVID19 requires unprecedented levels of int'l cooperation,"" Ryan Sitton, a commissioner at the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state's energy industry, tweeted Thursday.  President Trump is also expected to meet with the heads of some of the largest US oil companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/cars/pirelli-ceo-interview-coronavirus/index.html,CEO of Italian tire maker Pirelli: US business leaders should prepare now for the worst,"""Considering that we are facing a very tough situation for many months. If we move in advance, we can cope with it and we can come out of it even stronger,"" said Marco Tronchetti Provera, who has led Pirelli since 1992. ""We have to work better with our customers and suppliers. We have to get closer one to another, to blend together to protect the weakest."" Tronchetti Provera has been running the Milan-based company from one of his homes since the coronavirus crisis first took hold in Italy over a month ago. Both of Pirelli's Italian factories and its corporate headquarters have been shut down so many of the company's office employees are working from home as well. The rest of Pirelli's roughly 3,000 employees in Italy, most of them factory workers, remain on the company payroll during the lockdown, a spokeswoman said, So far, Italy has suffered more deaths from the virus than any other country in the world and the nation remains on lockdown. As the United States struggles to contain its own outbreak, Tronchetti Provera spoke with CNN Business by phone about how the crisis is already changing his company. ""We are a traditional company, we are not an Internet company, and [for employees] to see the CEO with no tie, with a dog beside him working in a teleconference is something that brings people closer to you,"" he said. ""So I think it's more human. It sounds the opposite of what it should be because technology is cold and makes us far away one from another."" Lessons learned so far Pirelli had already been dealing with the effects of the coronavirus at the company's facilities in China before it hit Italy. Tronchetti Provera said that experience helped the company to better understand what to expect. Production at Pirelli's three Chinese factories dropped to about 20% of its normal volume. It has since recovered to about 60%, he said. Office life in China isn't entirely back to normal, though. Most workers have returned, he said, but protective measures, such as social distancing and the use of protective gear, are still being taken. ""People respect the rules,"" he said. ""They are back, but they have to be very, let's say, under control."" Luckily, he said, none of the company's more than 5,000 workers in China were effected by coronavirus. But he noted that the company's factories there are not located near Wuhan, the center of the virus's spread. Things are different in Italy, where two employees have tested positive for the virus so far. It's something Tronchetti Provera called inevitable given that the company is headquartered at the center of the outbreak. One of the workers had already been at home when the infection was found. The other had been working at a plant that was then thoroughly disinfected before the factory was briefly reopened with a reduced workforce, a Pirelli spokesman said. That factory is now closed. ""We have to apply in the factories all the rules to protect people and thinking the situation will be much worse than what our advisers are telling us today,"" Tronchetti Provera said. He said he was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the company was able to make organizational and systems changes to deal with the crisis. Pirelli had already been rolling out digital systems for internal communication when the shutdown occurred, and that process had to be accelerated. The company has also had to make wider use of digital training platforms. ""We are activating processes that, on paper, we should have been implementing in the next months, some believe in the next years. We implemented these projects in days, in weeks,"" he said. ""So parameters are changing. What we have today was unthinkable two months ago."" Preparing for the worst But Tronchetti Provera is not optimistic about economic recovery once the crisis passes. The economic impact, he said, is likely to be even worse than most people think. ""We have to anticipate the market. We have to reduce the stocks to minimum possible level,"" he said. ""We have to produce only for on-demand [orders] because the market will be very weak for many months."" As a result, Pirelli has taken steps to cut costs, freeze investments and reduce production, he said. ""If we are able to [we must] protect our finances, our cash flow, our profitability. We have to act in order to protect the basics of our balance sheet,"" he said.  Tronchetti Provera also called on other countries, in Europe and elsewhere, to do more to help one another.  ""No one can survive this alone,"" he said. ""Not even the United States, which is the strongest, the most independent. But they need the world to continue to grow and if we don't get together, in one way or another, the world won't grow and it will be bad for everybody.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/tech/tesla-sales-production/index.html,"Tesla overcomes plant shutdowns to again build 100,000 cars in quarter","The company delivered only about 88,400 of the 102,672 cars it built for customers. The number of completed sales was up 40% from the year earlier. But it was down 21% from the record fourth quarter sales that lifted Tesla to its first annual operating profit. Still, that beat recently lowered Wall Street estimates of 80,000 deliveries in the quarter. It was ""a small victory in a dark environment,"" according to a note from analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. Tesla had to temporarily halt production at its new factory in Shanghai in late January due to restrictions put in place in China to combat the coronavirus. It kept its main plant in Fremont, California running even as state officials ordered non-essential businesses in the area to shut. But on March 19 it went ahead and suspended production there as well. Most of the auto industry suffered steep declines in car sales in the first quarter due to shutdowns in much of the United States, Europe and Asia in an effort to battle coronavirus. Forecasts for US and global sales for the entire industry have been slashed in recent weeks. Even with the decline in sales from the company's fourth quarter results, the first quarter performance helped to lift Tesla shares 17% in after-hours trading. Shares of Tesla were among the hottest in the market from June through mid-February, gaining more than 400% in less than nine months as it reached a record close of $917.42 on Feb. 19.  Since then its shares have lost half their value as markets overall declined globally. Even so, they still were up 150% from the June low as of the close on Thursday before the after-hours surge in the price.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/economy/recession-how-long-will-it-be/index.html,How quickly can the US economy bounce back? That depends on the virus,"How quaint that seems now. That was before airlines canceled thousands of flights, sports leagues paused their seasons and restaurants and retailers shut their doors. Schools and day cares hadn't closed down, and social interaction was not yet limited to 6-foot distances and Zoom conference calls. Now, Americans are holed up inside their homes, and millions have filed for unemployment benefits. So the question is no longer — will we have a recession — but how deep will it be? And how quickly will the economy recover? You'll hear economists throw around phrases like V-shape, L-shape and U-shape to describe the range of possibilities.  V-shape: The hope is that, given trillions of dollars in government aid, the economy will be able to flip a switch just as quickly as it shut down. Once the spread of the virus slows businesses will be able to open their doors, people will return to work and the economy will make a speedy recovery. That's what economists call a V-shaped recession, and some think it's possible, now that the Federal Reserve and Congress have committed trillions of dollars to rescuing the economy. But that scenario largely depends on the virus. Morgan Stanley economists are predicting a sharp economic decline followed by a quick bounce back. They forecast US gross domestic product will contract at an annual pace of 30% in the second quarter, far deeper than any other quarterly decline on record. But after that, they think GDP will grow at a 29% annualized pace from July through September. As severe as that sounds, that's actually an optimistic forecast, because no one knows how long it will take the United States to contain the coronavirus pandemic and relax social distancing measures. Morgan Stanley's prediction assumes the outbreak peaks in April or early May, and businesses reopen shortly afterward. L-shape: The worst-case scenario is that the virus is not contained, social distancing measures remain in place into the summer, and businesses and consumers will take years to get back up to speed. In that case, the economic recovery could be L-shaped.  That's what happened after the Great Recession. Economic activity took four years to return to its pre-recession peak.  Even then, a majority of Americans still didn't feel they had recovered.  The Great Depression, which began in 1929, was even more severe and was followed by a painfully slow recovery lasting through World War II. Those L-shape recoveries look more like a hockey stick with a long tail. No one wants an L-shape recovery, and so far, most economists are not predicting this outcome. U-shape: There's also an in-between scenario: It's the U-shaped recession, and it might be the most likely one today. A U-shaped recession is like a bathtub, Simon Johnson, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, once explained.  ""You go in. You stay in. The sides are slippery. You know, maybe there's some bumpy stuff in the bottom, but you don't come out of the bathtub for a long time,"" he told PBS in 2009. In other words, the economy contracts, remains subdued for a while, and then climbs back. This is a plausible outcome following the coronavirus pandemic for a few reasons. Businesses, even with government aid, will be grappling with heightened uncertainty about the future. For business owners and managers, the pandemic has made a previously unthinkable situation real. Now that they've lived through a scenario where businesses are suddenly shut down en masse throughout the country, that shock could damage their investments and change behavior in the future, making some spend more conservatively. Although businesses may eventually came back to life after social distancing measures lift, it won't happen all at once. As for consumer spending, the largest contributor to US economic activity, that too is unlikely to bounce back immediately. Part of that is due to a decline in incomes, especially for workers who have been furloughed or laid off.  But there's a psychological impact, too, said Elena Duggar, chair of Moody's Macroeconomic Board.  The coronavirus pandemic has already disrupted human behavior in dramatic ways, ranging from social distancing to panic-buying toilet paper. Consumers will probably be wary of making big purchases even when the economy begins to come back to life. They're unlikely to suddenly return to their pre-coronavirus levels of spending, Duggar said. Finally, spending that would have taken place in the second quarter isn't necessarily going to be made up later in the year. Travelers whose spring break trips were canceled are probably not going to take two summer vacations. Consumers are not going to eat double the meals at restaurants, or go to twice as many movies later in the year, simply because they missed out on those things in the spring.  ""There's going to be a significant part of economic activity that will be lost permanently,"" Duggar said. Nevertheless, businesses and consumers will eventually recover — and could do so more quickly than they did after the Great Recession, Duggar said. Hence her U-shape forecast. Uncertainty and unknowns All of this, though — the shape of the recession and its duration — is highly uncertain. And it depends on one big unknown: the course of the virus.  In a recent report, McKinsey consultants and economists from Oxford Economics laid out nine different economic scenarios. In one of the rosier outcomes, in which the virus is successfully controlled and economic restrictions are lifted after two to three months, economic activity falls 8% in the first half of the year, but then rebounds to its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2020. However, if the virus is not contained within the second quarter, and social distancing measures continue into the summer, McKinsey expects GDP could take more than two years to climb back up to to its pre-coronavirus level.  ""If we're in a situation where we have a third of the workforce not able to go to the work through the summer, you're going to see a lot of bankruptcies. You're going to see a lot of corporate debt defaults. The longer this goes on, the more permanent the damage to businesses and individuals,"" said Susan Lund, a McKinsey partner and one of the co-authors of the report. ""What it depends on, first of all, is how quickly we can control the virus.""",4/3/2020

""For that, I am deeply sorry.""  Zoom will stop adding new features for the next 90 days and instead focus solely on addressing privacy issues, Yuan said. The company will also release a transparency report, similar to the ones periodically shared by tech giants such as Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR), which details requests for data or content from government authorities.  The coronavirus outbreak has seen millions of people ordered to stay in their homes flock to Zoom, which has garnered praise for its features and usability. Yuan said Zoom crossed 200 million daily meeting participants in the month of March. People have used the video conference app for everything from brunches and birthday parties to religious events and even a UK cabinet meeting. But the spike in popularity has led the company to quickly find itself dealing with many of the issues that have plagued larger online platforms, particularly around privacy.  This week alone, Zoom has come under scrutiny from the New York Attorney General and the FBI, faced questions from security experts about the level of encryption on its platform, and been hit with two class action lawsuits over a feature (which it has since deactivated) that shared some user data with Facebook.  The controversy has hit Zoom's previously meteoric stock price, which had nearly doubled since the end of January but closed 11% lower on Thursday and has fallen around 24% this week.  Yuan said Zoom was created mainly for ""large institutions with full IT support"" such as universities, government agencies and financial services companies.  ""We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,"" he added. ""We now have a much broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways, presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate.""  Zoom also apologized for its misleading claim that it offers ""end-to-end encryption for all meetings,"" which would mean that all content on its platform is visible only to participants. Some security experts expressed doubt about Zoom's ability to provide that level of encryption, saying the type of encryption it provides would allow the company to access some information through its servers.  Oded Gal, Zoom's chief product officer, said in a blog post on Wednesday that Zoom does not decrypt any information if all participants of a meeting are on its app and if the meeting is not being recorded. Full encryption is not possible if any of the participants are dialed in from a phone or another external device.  ""While we never intended to deceive any of our customers, we recognize that there is a discrepancy between the commonly accepted definition of end-to-end encryption and how we were using it,"" Gal said.

After talks with unions, British Airways agreed to provide workers with 80% of their regular pay, with no cap on earnings, according to the major UK union, Unite. The first £2,500 ($3,095) will be paid by the government, with BA making up the shortfall, Unite said in a statement. There will be no unpaid temporary layoffs and the measures will be in place until the end of May. This is ""as good a deal as possible for our members,"" said Oliver Richardson, Unite's national officer for aviation. ""The deal protects the jobs of BA staff and, as far as possible, also protects their pay,"" he said in a statement. British Airways, which on Monday suspended flights from London's Gatwick airport, is the latest major European carrier to announce sweeping operational changes. On Monday, UK budget carrier EasyJet (ESYJY) grounded its entire fleet, furloughing 4,000 cabin crew. Europe's largest low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) will ground more than 90% of its aircraft over the coming weeks, while Scotland-based Loganair plans to approach the government for financial aid.  Airlines around the world have been brought to their knees as the pandemic worsens, particularly in Europe and North America, with flight bans and nationwide lockdowns threatening to shut down aviation altogether. Many carriers have slashed or suspended their short-term flight schedules, placed workers on unpaid leave and paused hiring. Several industry CEOs have stopped taking salaries.  Bailouts ahead While US airlines will receive tens of billions of dollars in support as part of the country's $2 trillion stimulus package, governments in Europe have not promised bailouts to their carriers. The UK government has said that airlines, like all companies, can make use of measures to help businesses hit by the coronavirus, including capital-raising programs and tax relief. ""We are continuing to work closely with the sector and are willing to consider the situation of individual firms, so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted, including raising capital from existing investors,"" a government spokesperson said. Virgin Atlantic on Thursday declined to comment on media reports that the airline is seeking financial assistance from the UK government. The company said that Richard Branson, its billionaire owner, is plowing $250 million into Virgin Group companies to protect jobs.  Lufthansa, which owns national carriers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium, said in a statement Thursday that it is ""in close contact"" with the federal governments of its home markets to secure its liquidity. A spokesperson for Airbus (EADSF) told CNN Business that the plane maker is ""strongly advocating government support for all airlines."" ""[There is] no more 'normal' for aviation,"" analysts at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said in a report Thursday. ""The revenue reduction faced by airlines this year as a result of COVID-19 far exceeds the impact from previous crises. It has the dimensions of a world war,"" they noted. The International Air Transport Association expects the crisis to cut industry revenues globally by $252 billion this year compared to 2019, with airlines burning through $61 billion in cash in the second quarter. -- Eoin McSweeney and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/alcohol-sales-coronavirus-trnd/index.html,Booze sales are booming as people stockpile alcohol ... but it may not last,"Alcoholic beverage sales shot up 55% in the third week of March compared to the same time a year ago, according to Nielsen. That's when several states, including New York, ordered people to ""shelter in place."" Those social distancing guidelines limited people from hanging out and restaurants and bars were ordered to close. However, many stores selling alcohol -- including liquor outlets or grocery stores -- stayed open. People quickly stocked up on spirits, wine and beer. Ready-to-drink cocktails, such as spiked lemonades or canned gin and tonics, grew the most: a 106% spike in sales, according to Nielsen. Hard seltzer sales also remained strong with White Claw and Truly remaining the top-selling brands.  Sales of beer, which has been gradually falling out favor with the American drinker, also soared. Nielsen said that larger packs of 24 or 30 both grew roughly 90% for the week compared to a year ago as people were preparing to limit their outside errands.  The week ending on March 21 will probably be the peak for alcohol sales, predicted Danelle Kosmal, vice president of Nielsen's Beverage Alcohol Practice Area. Subsequent weeks will be a ""better indicator of the new normal in how consumers are responding to the crisis,"" as people consume the alcohol they've stockpiled and as more Americans lose their jobs. Sales could fall this month if there's a deeper recession and people shift their spending to essentials like food, noted Laurent Grandet, an analyst at Guggenheim. He expects sales to remain strong for cheaper beer like Budweiser but warns that the craft beer industry will be hurt. Around 70% of its sales come from the brewer's taprooms or at bars, which are both currently closed in much of the US, he said.  ""It's a perfect storm for the craft beer business,"" he told CNN Business. He said they will further be harmed since retailers pick larger brands to stock their shelves because they're easier to get. Even when social distancing rules are eased and the country gets back to something resembling normalcy, the recovery in alcohol sales won't be immediate. People might still be wary of rushing back to bars or restaurants, and Grandet predicts 20% won't reopen. It will also take time for the supply chain to ramp up production again. ",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/investing/luckin-coffee-accounting-probe-stock/index.html,China's Luckin Coffee plunges 75% on accounting probe,"Shares of Luckin Coffee (LK) plunged 80% in early trading Thursday after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its board had formed a committee to look into accounting irregularities. Luckin said in the filing that beginning in the second quarter of 2019, chief operating officer Jian Liu and several of his direct reports ""had engaged in certain misconduct, including fabricating certain transactions."" Luckin said Liu has since been suspended. The company added that the fabricated transactions amounted to about 2.2 billion yuan (approximately $310 milion US) from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of last year.  ""Certain costs and expenses were also substantially inflated by fabricated transactions during this period,"" Luckin added in the SEC filing. Luckin went public on the Nasdaq last May, which is why the company needs to file regular updates with the SEC.  The stock surged shortly after its Wall Street debut thanks to soaring sales and an aggressive expansion plan. It seemed that Luckin was going toe to toe with Starbucks (SBUX), which has a massive presence in China, and was more than holding its own against the global coffee giant. Shares of Luckin were down sharply this year -- even before Thursday's accounting bombshell -- due to concerns that Covid-19 were affecting its  sales.  The stock, along with other Chinese consumer companies that trade in the US, rallied earlier this week. A strong manufacturing sector report in China raised hopes that the Chinese economy was taking a turn for the better following the coronavirus outbreak.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/perspectives/small-biz-coronavirus/index.html,"Small business owner: I'm losing $20,000 a day. Here's how the government can help me","For 38 years, we have been manufacturing handbags, belts and other accessories using imported Italian leather. We also supply leather goods for just about every designer boutique in New York City. My dad started the business after emigrating from Lebanon with $400 in his pocket. We're a classic American success story, but right now our survival, and the livelihoods of our 40 employees, is in serious jeopardy.  Although handbags are not essential during a pandemic, our machinery and industrial capacity should not lay dormant. Our factories can be converted in a matter of days to produce thousands of protective masks and gowns for health care workers every day. We have already sourced three-ply polypropylene non-woven fabric for masks and polyethylene plastic for gowns. The masks we produce will not match the FDA safety standards of N95 masks, but N95 masks are in very short supply. The polyethylene gowns may meet FDA standards, but we need guidance to be certain. If the hospitals will buy our masks, our employees can return to work and join the fight against coronavirus. I'm not doing this to make a profit -- I just want to help by putting our machines and our people to use. We will, of course, stagger our employees' hours and create separation on the manufacturing floor to ensure our employees are safe. I have reached out to the city and state and hope to hear back from them soon.  Meanwhile, I'm also looking at every resource, government grant and loan program. The emergency $10,000 grant in the federal stimulus package is nice, but already my small business is losing $20,000 each day.  I am also going to apply to the long-term forgivable loan program, but the fine print in the terms and conditions -- which has not been finalized -- will make or break this program. These long-term, low-interest loans could help us survive, but without clear rules on how these loans may be forgiven and without assurance that they cannot be changed by a future Congress, they could become an economic burden that could put us out of business in the future. The Connected Commerce Council, a nonprofit trade organization, has been keeping a comprehensive list of other emergency funding and assistance options, but I am worried these too won't be enough. We need grants that will help cover rent, payroll and health insurance. Grants mean life for a small business; loans mean a slow, miserable death. Our company lost half of our employees after 9/11, but bounced back to open a second factory in 2012. We also survived the 2008 recession without any help from the government. The difference now is that we are deemed nonessential, so we have to temporarily close. We are going to fight every single day through this crisis. But we need the government, including the Food and Drug Administration, to help us get certified and guide us to manufacture masks and protective gear and provide us with the grants we need to weather this storm. To paraphrase New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, we will fight and win, because we are New Yorkers. I'm proud to be here, to carry on my father's legacy and fight this virus alongside my neighbors.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/media/chris-cuomo-coronavirus-reliable-sources/index.html,Chris Cuomo shares covid-19 experience: 'The beast comes at night' ,"CNN's Chris Cuomo has become the most visible face of the coronavirus in the United States by giving daily updates about his condition on TV, social media and, on Thursday, at his brother's New York state press briefing. Other television stars (Andy Cohen) and household names (Tom Hanks) have contracted the virus... there are more than I can list at this point... but Cuomo stands out because he is giving frequent updates to an audience of millions of people. He began to anchor from home on Monday, and he was formally diagnosed on Tuesday. On Thursday night his 9 p.m. program was pre-empted for CNN's weekly town hall about the virus, so he joined from his home for a check-up. ""I'm doing well. The beast comes at night,"" he told Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""As we know the health care workers have taken to call the virus 'the beast.' I understand why. My fever has gone up a couple of degrees in like the last 30 minutes. Nights are tough, and I've learned something that I didn't know before: It is responsible journalism to say that 80% of people who get this, statistically, wind up okay, meaning they don't get a hospital, they get through it. It is not humanly responsible, though, from an ethical perspective. Now that I am one of the anointed and these people reach out to me -- you SUFFER when you have this at home, unless you are ridiculously lucky, statistically, and maybe karmically as well."" Cuomo said he has lost 13 pounds in the past three days. ""I'm just sweating it out and it's the sickness,"" he said. Chicken soup has helped. B.S. on the internet hasn't helped. ""Fake pills, fake tonics... I think we have to be very careful about people preying on desperation,"" he said. ""Incapable of not working"" Just ""for the record,"" Gupta said to Cuomo, ""we had suggested you not work right now. I mean, you are incapable of not working and talking about this but just for the record, we did suggest that."" I respect the suggestion, but I respect the work ethic more! Cuomo said, ""In between the hits and in between when I'm doing the show, I'm a waste. I sleep probably 10 hours of the day if I can, in and out. I try to walk and do these breathing exercises because I'm petrified of getting pneumonia."" His main message on Thursday night: ""It's not a cakewalk, but we can get through it."" ""We're telling ourselves these lies about testing"" One more note from Cuomo's comments on the town hall -- because this can't be said enough -- the testing #'s are still so far from complete. ""When I do have a couple of good hours, I'm still trying to do help with procurement for the state [of New York] because they really are fighting state by state, which is so stupid, to get the equipment that they need,"" Cuomo said. ""So, I don't know how I got it and most people don't, Anderson, and we are so far behind on testing. We're telling ourselves these lies about testing. We're nowhere near where we need to be."" ""The Cuomo show"" That's what the AP's David Bauder calls it: ""With all their familial love and drama, the Cuomo brothers — Andrew during the daytime, Chris at night — have become compelling figures in the plague-driven landscape of American television..."" Chris Cuomo's cameo during Governor Andrew Cuomo's Thursday press briefing was the latest example of this. ""I do believe this is going to be a great public service in an ironic way... You living it, showing it... doing the show, reporting on how you feel... I think it demystifies this,"" the governor said. ""It takes a lot of the unknown out of the equation. And I know it's a terrible unfortunate circumstance for you, but think about it from a journalistic point of view, a public service point of view. You are answering questions for millions of Americans.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/economy/childcare-gender-equality-coronavirus/index.html,Millions of dads are stuck at home — which could be a game changer for working moms,"Four economists have a hypothesis for how this shock could play out on a massive scale. In a new research paper, Matthias Doepke and Jane Olmstead-Rumsey of Northwestern University, Titan Alon of the University of California San Diego and Michèle Tertilt of the University of Mannheim predict two big outcomes for gender equality. First, the bad news: Over the short run, they predict, working moms will shoulder a higher burden than dads when it comes to providing childcare in the pandemic.  But there's also good news: Millions of dads have suddenly been forced to stay home with their kids. This historic moment could forever shift dynamics in both firms and families, leading to greater gender equality down the road. Here's how. Why moms have it harder The coronavirus recession will be different than any other downturn for many reasons. Among them: the way it impacts women and men in the labor force. First, some history. Early on in recessions, it's common for men to lose more jobs than women. The Great Recession, for example, was even nicknamed the ""mancession"" because initially men bore 78% of the job losses. This happens in part because men dominate sectors like manufacturing and construction, which are prone to steep declines in an economic downturn, whereas women dominate jobs in nursing and teaching, which are more resistant to job losses. With the coronavirus recession, however, the steepest layoffs early on are in low-wage service jobs, which are closer to 50-50, if not slightly skewed toward women. Women hold 52% of restaurant jobs, 60% of hotel jobs and 50% of retail jobs, for example. According to Doepke and his colleagues, women are also slightly less likely than men to work in occupations that have high rates of telecommuting, like computer, financial and mathematical professions. For working moms in any of these groups, serving as the primary childcare provider is more of a necessity than a choice now that work has dried up and schools are closed. Among middle class and higher income couples — particularly those who have the ability to work from home — job losses may not be as severe, but tradeoffs within families will still be common. After all, someone has to watch the kids. In heterosexual couples, that responsibility is still likely to fall on women.  That's for several reasons including the pay gap and social norms. On average, working women make less than their male partners, spend more time on unpaid household labor including cooking, cleaning and childcare, and are more likely to sacrifice their own careers to prioritize their partner's work. These things are all true today even though women have made significant strides over the last 50 years.  As of 2017, men still out-earned women in 69% of heterosexual couples, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. That pay gap, for many families, leads to a default decision to prioritize the husband's career. ""In the majority of households, where the man is the higher earner, there is going to be a temptation to cater to his career — and it's not impossible that it could have longer term effects,"" said Francine Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University who has conducted numerous studies on the gender pay gap. It's not just money that makes the decision. Even in families where women are the higher breadwinner, research has shown moms are more likely than dads to opt out of the labor force to care for children.  ""In a lot of cases, gender trumps money,"" said Kristin Smith, a visiting research associate professor at Dartmouth who wrote her Ph.D dissertation on that phenomenon. ""Our social roles are so much more powerful in decision-making than money."" All these dynamics are unfolding in households now in response to the dearth of childcare during the coronavirus pandemic. Which is why it's not surprising Doepke and his colleagues hypothesize working moms are likely picking up the largest share of childcare and homeschooling in many homes. It will take years for economists to collect all the data and analyze whether this was actually the case. But right now, they are also hopeful this moment could eventually lead to lasting change.  A moment like World War II While many mothers are likely to pick up the largest share of childcare during the crisis, that won't be true in all families. In some households, traditional gender roles will be reversed. Take for example families with moms who work in the health care industry and are fighting Covid-19 on the frontlines. Women hold 4 million or 78% of all hospital jobs. They also hold 70% of pharmacy jobs and 51% of grocery store roles, another area that has been crucial in the pandemic. In many of these families, men will inevitably turn into the main childcare providers, either because they lost their own jobs or are able to work from home, Doepke and his colleagues say. Overall, that will mean millions of dads will suddenly find themselves as the primary caregiver, many for the first time in their lives. Such a dramatic shift in gender roles hasn't happened since World War II, when millions of married women entered the labor force for the first time to replace men in factories. That moment in history, still symbolized by Rosie the Riveter in the popular imagination, ended up increasing the participation of some married women — particularly white, educated women — in the labor force, even after the war ended, according to research by Harvard economist Claudia Goldin and Dartmouth economist Claudia Olivetti. Likewise, Doepke and his colleagues think the coronavirus pandemic could increase men's participation in household labor, including childcare, even after the pandemic is over. They cite studies documenting how paternity leave policies in Spain and Germany increased fathers' involvement in childcare later on. ""During the current crisis, many millions of men are on a form of forced paternity leave for a much longer period, and a sizeable fraction will be the main providers of childcare during this time,"" Doepke and his colleagues wrote. ""Hence, even while women carry a higher burden during the crisis, it is still highly likely that we will observe a sizeable impact of this forced experiment on social norms, and ultimately on gender equality, in the near future."" If that prediction comes true, it could be a game changer for working moms, who often grapple with a ""second shift"" of unpaid labor at home. Women spend more time on household labor than men in every industrialized nation tracked by the OECD. In the US, women spend an extra hour and 12 minutes each day on housework and childcare than men do. There's another way, too, that the coronavirus pandemic could advance gender equality. Many businesses are adopting widespread work-from-home options for the first time. Now that they've invested in telecommuting technologies and acclimated to that experience, it's unlikely they'll go all the way back to the pre-pandemic way of working. Doepke and his colleagues predict some flexible work arrangements will remain in place. ""All these companies now have to make this work, with families being at home and having these other responsibilities,"" Doepke said. ""It might be a culture shock that has implications on equality.""  According to Goldin's research, the lack of flexible work arrangements is one factor that drives the pay gap between men and women. If that were to change, and more companies encouraged flexible work options in the future, that shift could possibly lead to a narrower pay gap, as well. Ultimately, how all this will play out is hard to say, Goldin said. But economists will study the coronavirus recession — and its reverberations on gender equality — for years to come.  ""On the gender front, we have made this into a 'war,'"" Goldin wrote in an email. ""WWII was fought in our factories first and then on land and sea. This war is being fought first in our hospitals, research labs, and the home front."" ""Let's see if dads step up to the plate and do 50-50,"" she added. ""Could that ever happen? I hope so.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/tech/zoom-video-privacy-concerns/index.html,"Zoom, the video conferencing app everyone is using, faces questions over privacy","While video chat apps in general have seen a surge in usage, including Microsoft's (MSFT) Skype and Teams platforms and Cisco's Webex, Zoom (ZM) has emerged as the go-to contender thanks to its ability to host a large number of users — up to 100 in the free version — and fun social features such as customizable photo backgrounds. The company's stock price has nearly doubled in the past two months.   But that surge in growth and the company's widespread usage have surfaced several concerns. In the last week alone, issues with Zoom's privacy protections have been flagged by users, security researchers and US authorities. The increased attention highlights a new front in the global debate over privacy and security as a result of the global pandemic, as millions of people adapt to working remotely and using technology that could potentially expose their data.  New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking whether the company ""is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security,"" a spokesman for James's office told CNN Business. In a statement, Zoom said it would address James's questions. ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,"" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. ""During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational.  We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information."" On Monday, the FBI issued a warning against ""Zoom-bombing,"" where hackers or trolls hijack a public video call. The agency cited examples of users entering meetings or virtual classrooms to shout profanities and share pornography. The FBI urged victims of ""teleconference hijacking"" to report any incidents to the agency.  Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan addressed some of those issues in a tweet on Friday, saying they stem from users not enabling some security features such as meeting passwords and additional privacy controls.  ""We will enforce these settings in addition to training and blogs,"" he said.  A Zoom spokesperson said the company was ""deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of attack.""  Users hosting large public meetings should review their settings to make sure only the hosts can share their screen, and activate additional privacy controls, the spokesperson added. ""We also recently updated the default screen sharing settings for our education users so teachers by default are the only ones who can share content in class.""  Founded nine years ago, Zoom has found itself suddenly become a vital social and professional lifeline for millions around the world. But that rapid growth has led to it already being hit by the kind of controversies that far larger tech companies like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) frequently grapple with.  ""They've gone from interesting new startup product to part of the global infrastructure in days. And I think the many gaps in maturity are becoming painfully clear,"" Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum and the former chief privacy officer of AOL, told CNN Business in an interview. ""Some of them range from just stupid stuff that maybe doesn't create risk to most users, to other things that are going to create legal liability for them."" Another recent issue, first reported by Motherboard, involves Zoom's sharing of user data with Facebook. Zoom originally allowed users to log into its iOS app using their Facebook accounts, but the feature it was using to do so shared details with Facebook about the user's device, including its timezone, language, model number and IP address. (Facebook offers the tool to any developer to integrate with their apps.) The revelation led to two Zoom users separately filing class action lawsuits against the company in a Northern California district court this week, with one suit alleging that the video app ""has failed to safeguard the personal information of the increasing millions of users of its software"" and the other claiming it gave them ""no opportunity to express or withhold consent to Zoom's misconduct."" The lawsuits accuse Zoom of collecting users' personal information and sharing it with third parties, including Facebook, without properly notifying the users.  Zoom declined to comment on the lawsuits, but directed CNN Business to a recent blog post in which it says it removed the code that allows the data sharing with Facebook to occur. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.  Some security experts have expressed doubts about Zoom's claim that it offers ""end-to-end encryption for all meetings.""  Instead, Zoom uses something called transport encryption, which only secures the message while it's en route from a video chat to the company's servers, according to David Kennedy, founder of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec and a former cyberwarfare specialist with the United States Marine Corps. That means Zoom effectively functions as a middleman in all video conversations on its platform and has access to those conversations, he said.  A report by The Intercept first identified the shortcoming.  Zoom did not respond to multiple requests for comment on its encryption. The company released an update to its privacy policy over the weekend, stressing that it ""collects only the data from individuals using the Zoom platform required to provide the service and ensure it is delivered effectively.""  The Zoom spokesperson acknowledged that the company collects ""basic technical information"" such as IP addresses and device details, but stressed that it has strict privacy controls to protect against unauthorized access.  ""Importantly, Zoom does not sell user data of any kind to anyone,"" the spokesperson added.  Without end-to-end encryption on video, Kennedy says video conversations on Zoom could technically be accessed and stored by the company.  ""Zoom doesn't seem to be very clear on what they record, what they don't record,"" he said. ""There's a lot of things that Zoom is doing that is particularly alarming and concerning, because they're not using the right language and terminology.""",4/3/2020

Its theme parks around the world have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and many of its biggest films of the year have been delayed. Live sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended. Shares of Disney (DIS) have plummeted more than 30% year to date. The impact is hitting Disney's theme park employees especially hard. All of Disney's twelve theme parks have been shuttered since March 15th, after which the company committed to paying salaries through April 18th. In the statement, the company said there was ""no clear indication of when we can restart our businesses,"" and that it was ""forced to make the difficult decision to take the next step and furlough employees."" More than 75% of the company's 223,000 employees work for the Parks and Products division. The furloughed workers would remain employees of the company and keep their health and education benefits, while also being able to access federal and state aid like unemployment benefits. Among those impacted could be the Disney Parks' storied ""Imagineers"" — the designers of the parks, rides and hotels.  Disney's announcement is one of the  signs of the economic destruction rippling through the travel industry, which employs some 319 million workers globally.  Disney executives announced earlier this week that they were taking a pay cut because of the pandemic. The company's CEO Bob Chapek said in an email to employees on Monday that he would take a 50% pay cut while Bob Iger, the company's executive chairman, will forgo all of his salary. ""While I am confident we will get through this challenging period together and emerge even stronger, we must take necessary steps to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company,"" Chapek wrote. Thursday's furlough announcement specifically relates to the company's US employees, executives, and non-union hourly workers.  -— This story previously misstated the date on which all Disney parks closed.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/easter-shopping-coronavirus/index.html,What the pandemic means for your Easter food shopping,"Last year, about 80% of Americans planned to celebrate the holiday, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, most people said they planned to spend the day with family and friends and cook a holiday meal.  This year, social distancing practices designed to help stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic mean large gatherings are off the table for most.  But people may still want to cook for themselves or their families.  ""We are likely to see people still wanting to commemorate Easter in some way,"" said Katherine Cullen, senior director of industry and consumer insights for the National Retail Federation's research team. She noted that the 80% figure has generally held steady ""regardless of where consumer confidence is.""   That's good news for the food companies and retailers that typically get a boost in sales around the holiday. This year, they're trying to make sure that shoppers are able to get traditional Easter foods, despite the tumultuous time. Still, shoppers may have to plan further ahead than usual or spend a little more.  Here's what to expect if you plan to cook at home this Easter.  Ham  For Honey Baked Ham, Easter is an important time.  ""Easter is one of our highest selling volumes times of the year,"" Jo Ann Herold, the company's chief marketing officer, told CNN Business in an email. She added that ""demand remains positive for our retail products including ham and turkey.""  This year, Honey Baked is offering $10 off to customers who pick up their hams from stores between April 3 and April 8, ahead of the April 12 holiday. ""We are extending what is typically a 3-day high-volume period to span over 8 days,"" explained Dan McAleenan, senior vice president of store operations. By spreading the shopping period out, Honey Baked hopes to reduce crowding in stores. It's also offering delivery via Uber Eats, limiting the amount of customers who can enter stores, holding special hours for senior citizens and taking other measures to try to keep customers and employees safe. Meat producer Smithfield Foods is also taking steps to ensure that shoppers are able to get ham this Easter.  The company has added more than 13 million pounds of bone-in and spiral hams this year to meet customer demand, John Pauley, the company's chief commercial officer of packaged meats, told CNN Business in an email.  He added that the company is also shipping out hams earlier than usual to make sure they arrive on time and working with its retail partners to make sure hams are available online and for pickup.   Eggs A surge in demand for eggs has sent prices through the roof in recent weeks. To keep up with the shopping frenzy, retailers ordered more eggs than usual, depleting egg producers' Easter supply.   Farmers can't instruct their hens to lay more eggs to meet a sudden rush on eggs. But that doesn't mean that customers won't be able to find eggs this Easter.   Some institutional egg buyers, like restaurants or cafeterias, are closed. That means that some of those eggs could be redirected to grocery store shelves.  ""It does look like the supply side is starting to catch up a little bit,"" said Brian Moscogiuri, director and egg analyst at Urner Barry, a commodity market research firm, adding that ""prices are finally starting to stabilize.""  Plus, people who stocked up on eggs a few weeks ago might not come back for more now. ""Consumers have a lot of inventory in their own refrigerators,"" he said. Because of that, producers ""likely won't need that same Easter inventory that they were projecting.""  But, Moscogiuri warned, ""we could still see a run on eggs."" Shoppers should still be able to find eggs for Easter, but they might be pricey. And customers might not be able to buy as much as they want. Some retailers have been limiting sales of eggs to prevent more hoarding. Others might raise prices, either because they're paying more for eggs or to try to ration supply, noted Moscogiuri.  Peeps Easter is particularly important for niche candy manufacturers, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, a research and consulting firm.  ""It's really important for Peeps,"" he said, because the colorful marshmallow chicks and bunnies are so tightly linked with Easter. Other candy makers, like Hershey (HSY) or Mars, sell their products throughout the year and on holidays like Halloween and Valentine's Day.  Although people tend to buy perishable food items like ham or eggs just a few days before holidays, they may shop for more shelf-stable goods, like chocolate, ahead of time. And because candy sellers tend to extend their seasons as much as possible, shoppers have been seeing Easter candy on shelves since February.  Under these circumstances, that's an advantage — especially for Peeps maker Just Born, which has temporarily closed its production facilities in Pennsylvania.  ""Thankfully, all of our production was pretty much done, already shipped and on its way to retailers even before the plant closed,"" said Matt Pye, senior vice president of sales and marketing. Just Born makes more than two billion Peeps a year, he said, and most of them are for Easter. It also makes Mike And Ike, Hot Tamales and Goldenberg's Peanut Chews. The company expects to make most of its Easter Peeps sales right around now. ""The two weeks before any holiday, especially for candy, are the most important,"" Pye said.  This year, sales are down up to 12% compared to last year, according to national retailers who sell Peeps, said Pye. That could be because Easter is earlier this year than last, which means there's a shorter shopping period between Valentine's Day — the most recent big candy holiday — and Easter.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/business/boeing-buyouts-layoffs/index.html,Boeing offering buyouts as it projects recovery will take years,"In a memo to employees, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said the company is offering voluntary layoff packages that will provide exiting employees with pay and benefits. Calhoun said the company is doing so ""to reduce the need for other workforce actions."" Boeing had 161,000 employees at the start of this year, with about a third of them represented by unions. The aircraft maker has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Airlines around the globe have seen their revenue virtually disappear and are taking steps to cut capital spending, including aircraft purchases. ""One thing is already clear: It will take time for the aerospace industry to recover from the crisis,"" Calhoun said in the memo.  ""When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different,"" he wrote. ""We will need to balance the supply and demand accordingly as the industry goes through the recovery process for years to come. It's important we start adjusting to our new reality now."" The $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress last week included a $50 billion bailout for US airlines. But most of Boeing sales are to airlines elsewhere in the world, and while bailouts are likely in some other countries, it's not clear how much help will be available. Some airlines are likely to go out of business, and most are expected to delay or cancel delivery of planes they had ordered. Boeing started the year with a backorder of 5,350 commercial jets that normally would have kept its plants building planes for years to come, since it can typically only complete about 800 jets a year. But more than 4,000 of those planes on order are destined for airlines outside of the United States. Boeing is also eligible for loan guarantees as part of that US government stimulus. The company has been taking other steps to preserve cash, including suspending its dividend payments for the first time since 1942. Last year it paid out $4.6 billion in dividends. And it also arranged to borrowed $13.8 billion from a syndicate of major banks in February, and drew down that cash last month. Boeing went into this crisis dealing with another of its own: The grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, due to two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.  It continued to build the jets for about 10 months after the grounding, but it had temporarily shutdown that line in January when it became apparent it would not get FAA approval to fly the jet again until the middle of this year. Last week it shut its other production lines in Washington state due following the death of one of the employees in Everett, Washington, due to the coronavirus. It has continue to pay its employees who are worked on those lines for at least two weeks.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/business/japan-coronavirus-work-lockdown-guilt-hnk-intl/index.html,"Even in the coronavirus pandemic, the Japanese won't work from home until Shinzo Abe makes them","Up until a few weeks ago, 52-year-old Hideya Tokiyoshi, who traveled into the capital from neighboring Saitama prefecture for work each day, was among them.  The English-language teacher moved to online lessons after his students grew anxious over the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 46,800 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University.  Tokiyoshi, however, is a rare case.  While Tokyo's governor Yuriko Koike has urged the city's 13.5 million residents to telework where possible until April 12, and major Japanese companies such as Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Nissan (NSANF) have asked staff to work from home, many employees are still commuting into the capital, where subway trains are busy during rush hour.  It's a similar story across Japan, where about 80% of companies do not have the ability to let their employees work remotely, according to 2019 government data.  And with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week declining to declare a state of emergency, which would put pressure on businesses to enforce social distancing, companies can still legally operate from their offices. Underpinning this is Japan's notorious hard-work culture. A 2016 government study found that one in five employees was at risk of working themselves to death. The country even has its own word for it: ""karoshi,"" or death by overwork, which is defined as employees working so hard that they die from stress-related diseases — or become so depressed that they kill themselves. ""The [coronavirus] information is on our mind and we're scared more than you would expect,"" tweeted Tokiyoshi recently. ""But for average Japanese, work is always the highest priority and the biggest excuse.  ""Unless [the] government shuts all businesses down with a few exemptions, no one will stay at home. We're slaves to work."" Exposing old habits The now-delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics were meant to showcase Japan as a high-tech nation with robots showing guests to their seats and artificial meteorites in the sky. In reality, often people are wedded to more traditional ways of conducting business.  The fax machine, for example, remains a fixture in many offices, and people still use the company stamp to give official documents a seal of approval. In Japan, personal and company stamps are often used instead of electronic or handwritten signatures.  During the pandemic, many multinational companies have turned to messaging and video conferencing software such as Slack (WORK), Webex and Zoom (ZM) to keep in touch with colleagues. But Rochelle Kopp, a business consultant at Japan Intercultural Consulting who has worked between Japan and the United States for more than three decades, says Japanese firms have not made sufficient IT investments to do this.  Many employees don't have laptops they can take home, Kopp said, and companies do not have VPNs or remote access to their servers, meaning things can only be accessed in person at the office. To accelerate change as the coronavirus crisis continues, Japan's Ministry of Labor is offering grants of up to $77,000 to help small and medium-sized companies prepare for teleworking, said Misaki Togoshi, a spokeswoman at the Japanese Teleworking Association.  Nevertheless, barriers remain. ""We've started receiving up to 25 applications a day since March 9 from companies that want to adopt teleworking practices, but the funding is finite so not everyone will receive it,"" Togoshi said.     Another barrier is that a quarter of Japan's population is aged 65 and over. Many still occupy senior positions and are not known for being tech savvy. In 2018, for example, the country's then 68-year-old cybersecurity minister admitted he had never used a computer in his professional life.   ""Even if the hardware became available, older people may not have the experience or knowledge to adapt quickly,"" said Hisakazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo. ""There's a clear digital divide in Japan.""     Face-to-face work culture   The reluctance to close offices and work remotely speaks to Japan's intense work culture, where employees are expected to put in long hours.  ""Some workers will stay at the office after hours because they think that the boss may be coming back after dinner with his associates,"" said Jesper Koll, a Japan-based economist and financial strategist. ""All of this is very real part of Japanese corporate culture."" The cultural emphasis on collective decision-making in Japan can also make people feel reluctant to work from home, where they will not be physically surrounded by colleagues. ""The situation in Japan is a bit unique compared to other countries where people have a more individualistic work style. It's easier for them to transition to teleworking,"" Kato said. ""In Japan, one person can't make an important decision alone at their home — people have to come together to make decisions."" In many places, governments have led by example. In Hong Kong, for instance, the government announced that civil servants would work from home when it asked private businesses to let employees work remotely. Japan has not done that. While some government employees are teleworking, many are still going into the office.   Nakane Tsuyoshi, a human resources officer at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Tokyo, is going to work, although the ministry has staggered the arrival times of staff, with some starting at 8 a.m. and others at 10 a.m.. ""We would worry that we can't help people and get the job done properly if we worked worked from home,"" he said.   At the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, workers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the delayed Olympics and those answering calls from the public are still going to the office, according to a spokesman.     Service industry More than 70% of Japan's workforce was also employed in the service sector in 2019, according to Japan's Bureau of Statistics. For many of those workers, it is near impossible to telework, Kato said.  Haru, who works as a massage therapist in a mall in Tokyo, still catches a bus to work. But now many customers are canceling their reservations, especially since 78 people tested positive for coronavirus in the capital on Tuesday — the country's highest single-day jump. ""I'm anxious as the number of cases keeps going up in Tokyo and I want to stay at home. But I feel conflicted,"" Haru said.  ""Even if the boss told us to close the shop and stay at home, we would have nothing to fall back on. So far, the government has only told people to avoid public gatherings and that has meant fewer customers for us. But the government hasn't specifically said how they would support businesses teetering on the edge."" Bebe Ishikawa runs a Tokyo business supplying fruit to cake shops, hotels and wedding venues. She manages five staff in her office, all of whom come to work. ""If they take the train, I tell them to come in late or leave early to avoid the rush hour or to take a traxi to and from their homes,"" she said.  Ishikawa said she understood that a complete lockdown might be needed eventually to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but warned that many businesses would go bankrupt. ""If we stop delivering our produce then that means our customers can't sell their commodity so each link in the supply chain is affected,"" she said.  False sense of security? So far Japan — a country of 127 million people — has more than 2,300 cases of coronavirus, including 57 deaths. A total of 472 people have recovered. However, Japan has only tested about 34,508 people, compared with over 431,700 people tested in South Korea, which has a population of 51 million.  The relatively low recorded infection rate has created a sense of security in Japan, which could be encouraging workers to go into their offices.   ""The [Japanese] government should be stricter like in Europe,"" Kato said. ""The government has too much faith in the public doing the right thing by themselves, but they should send a clearer and more decisive message that tells people that this [coronavirus] situation is really serious.""  Back in Saitama, Tokiyoshi has embraced his teleworking lifestyle and found more time for passion projects. He and his students have overcome the occasional delayed connection, and he hopes this work style can become more accepted in the long term. ""Before, people thought it would be impossible for people to work from home as employees might not be able to focus on their jobs. But now people have realized they can do a lot of things from home,"" he said.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/perspectives/pandemic-insurance/index.html,Taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for pandemics. Here's a solution,"Covid-19 has shown that waiting to respond to epidemics can prove catastrophic. It has proven that we need to prepare for the financial fallout of the next major pandemic. But how? That's where the insurance industry can help.  It's easy to imagine that catastrophes like Covid-19 represent ""acts of god,"" meaning it's a catastrophe that can't be predicted or prevented and only the government can offer meaningful capacity to respond. Not so. In a litany of other catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, cyberterror, floods and droughts, to name a few, companies get detailed industry-specific risk assessments and obtain insurance to protect against business losses.  The terror attack on 9/11 showed us how we can do that in a new way. It forced the private sector to confront risks it previously had neglected. Lenders, for example, would no longer agree to finance the construction of high rises without terrorism insurance, and insurers were ill-equipped to offer such coverage. What resulted was the Terrorism Response Insurance Act (TRIA), which provides a public 'backstop' to the insurance industry. The insurance industry can write policies to protect against terrorism, but if the losses go beyond a certain level the government agrees to step in.  Over the past week, Congress has drafted a similar act for pandemics. It's fair to ask why the government needs to step in at all. But right now the default is that the government pays for everything. Programs like TRIA pass the first costs to the private sector and enable the growth of new insurance solutions to absorb risk. Over time, as insurers adapt to a post Covid-19 reality, just as they did post-9/11, insurers will learn how to take more of the burden on. Sadly Covid-19 will not be the last epidemic we experience. But if we learn from it as we learned from 9/11, it may be the last one that taxpayers alone are on the hook for.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/tech/amazon-coronavirus-safety-measures/index.html,Amazon says it's taking coronavirus seriously. Workers say the company is endangering their health,"The announcements illustrate the pressure Amazon (AMZN) is under as it grapples with a tidal wave of delays for sold-out items and complaints from employees about workplace safety during the pandemic. Despite Amazon's expressions of support for its workforce, some Amazon employees and applicants told CNN Business that the company's messaging doesn't always match what they have seen inside the company's warehouses, and that they remain concerned about crowded hiring events and training sessions, limited access to disinfectant wipes and the company's overall ability to follow through on its commitments.  Confirmed cases of the coronavirus are known to have hit more than a dozen Amazon facilities in recent weeks, prompting calls for multiple fulfillment centers to be closed for deep cleaning. Employees of at least three sites have staged walkouts this week protesting Amazon's decision to keep the centers open for business. Workers at Amazon's LGB3 facility in Eastvale, Calif., have created a petition to close the building, saying the demands of their job make it impossible to comply with the company's social distancing guidelines. One of the changes Amazon mentioned in its blog post Thursday is daily temperature checks for employees in the United States and Europe, which the company said it began on Sunday. More than 100,000 employees per day are now receiving temperature checks, the blog post said.  As part of a response to several questions from CNN Business, an Amazon spokesperson declined to provide a list of facilities where temperature checks have begun. The company previously told CNN Business that it is piloting the temperature checks in ""in select sites in New York City and Seattle,"" including its Staten Island facility, JFK8. But two Amazon employees who spoke with CNN Business portrayed an effort at JFK8 that is less comprehensive than the company is admitting.  Employees of JFK8 were notified on Sunday via a message in the employee ""A to Z"" app that beginning that day, the company would ""begin conducting a daily temperature check for everyone entering the building for the first time that day at the start of their shift,"" according to a screenshot viewed by CNN Business.  But the two employees at JFK8 who spoke with CNN Business about the checks said the company did not check their temperatures, or the temperatures of other workers, when they were entering the facility at certain times this week. One of the employees said they started experiencing symptoms during a shift this week and that a manager instructed them to go home. On the way out of the facility, security took their temperature, and found a fever above the 100.4F threshold recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. When asked why some workers did not have their temperature checked upon arriving, an Amazon spokesperson could not explain it, but claimed that all employees at the facility have been receiving the temperature screenings every day since Sunday. The mixed messaging continued on Thursday, when employees at JFK8 saw a new message in the employee app, also viewed by CNN Business, that suggested daily temperature checks had not yet begun as previously claimed.  ""In the next few days, we will begin conducting a daily temperature check,"" the message read. ""You'll be notified when this is starting at your site."" Amazon told CNN Business that the message was delivered to JFK8 employees as part of a wider communication to company associates. Amazon declined to provide an updated count of the number of coronavirus cases at its Staten Island facility, where employees have claimed that as many as 10 workers have been diagnosed but only three cases have been disclosed. In Thursday's blog post, Amazon also described disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer as ""standard"" across the company, but several employees told CNN Business that supplies were extremely limited at the facilities where they work. At the DTW1 facility in Romulus, Michigan, Amazon issues just three disinfecting wipes per shift -— one at the beginning of each shift and one after each of two breaks, Mario Crippen, an employee at the facility who led one of the strikes this week, said. ""One person walks around handing it out so you got to wait until they come around to you to get a disinfectant wipe,"" he said.  Hand sanitizer is limited, too, according to Crippen.  ""They have one person outside the break room squirting hand sanitizer on people's hands because we're running so low,"" he said.  Two Amazon employees at SDF4, a facility in Kentucky, told CNN Business that hand sanitizer bottles at the site are empty, disinfecting wipes are being rationed and Clorox wipes are unavailable. ""We Amazon employees work hard every day, the least [the company] could do is be honest about the condition of things inside the belly of this beast,"" one of the SDF4 employees told CNN Business. Amazon acknowledged to CNN Business the possibility of cleaning supply shortages at some sites, but said it has added 450,000 containers of disinfecting wipes and tens of thousands of hand sanitizer containers to its facilities. In Thursday's blog post, Amazon also said that face masks it has ordered for workers are finally becoming available and will be distributed in the coming days, and that the company is conducting daily audits of the new safety measures it has implemented since the outbreak began. Those measures include more aggressive cleaning, policies designed to keep employees separated, and requirements that delivery drivers wipe down their vehicles with disinfectants at the beginning and end of every shift.  Amazon added that it has hired 80,000 of its planned surge of 100,000 workers, reflecting how quickly the company has had to adjust to spikes in customer demand. But the need to hire so many people so quickly has created some potentially dangerous situations.  One job applicant told CNN Business she arrived for her interview with Amazon only to discover what she estimated as 30 to 40 applicants crammed into a single waiting room, with many people having to stand because all the chairs were taken. The company had provided a solitary bottle of hand sanitizer for the room, and some people were coughing and sneezing. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing her employment prospects, said she took one look at the situation and fled. She has not rescheduled her interview. ""I'm never applying for Amazon again,"" she told CNN Business. According to Crippen, new hires are being packed closely together in training rooms at the facility where he works. Last week, he said, the facility hired 86 new workers who needed on-boarding. ""Some of the people that do the new-hire training are afraid to do it,"" Crippen said. ""There are so many people at one given time and there's no way to social distance in one room."" Amazon said that its recruitment centers follow social distancing guidelines, with markers laid out on floors to separate job candidates. Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in Thursday's blog post that the company has made more than 150 changes to its processes to enhance worker safety. ""With over 1,000 sites around the world, and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks, there may be instances where we don't get it perfect,"" Clark wrote, ""but I can assure you that's just what they'll be — exceptions.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/tech/wework-softbank-bailout/index.html,WeWork founder misses out on $1 billion as SoftBank cancels share buyout,"The Japanese tech company has backed out of a plan to buy $3 billion worth of shares in the coworking startup from existing shareholders and investors, according to statements from SoftBank and a special committee of WeWork's board.  SoftBank's chief legal officer, Rob Townsend, said in a statement on Thursday that the share purchase was subject to certain conditions agreed to in October. ""Several of those conditions were not met, leaving SoftBank no choice but to terminate the tender offer,"" he said. Shares in SoftBank (SFTBY) closed up 2.5% in Tokyo following the announcement.  The about face cuts deep for Neumann — the October agreement had included an offer to buy up to $975 million worth of the WeWork founder's shares — and is further evidence that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is stepping back from his trademark high-risk investment strategy after the company's shares cratered earlier this year.  SoftBank cited several conditions that WeWork didn't meet, including failing to obtain necessary antitrust approvals by April 1, the existence of ""multiple, new, and significant pending criminal and civil investigations"" into the company and global restrictions related to Covid-19 affecting WeWork and its operations. WeWork declined to comment. However, the special committee of WeWork's board said in a statement on Wednesday that it ""is surprised and disappointed"" by SoftBank's move. It added that it will evaluate all legal options, including litigation. Last year, WeWork's botched IPO left it teetering on the edge of insolvency until SoftBank stepped in with a rescue package worth roughly $10 billion at the time. The original deal gave SoftBank 80% ownership of the startup. Neumann had already stepped down as CEO amid anger from employees and investors over his leadership of the company.  At an earnings presentation last month, Son boasted about a turn around plan that would see WeWork generating positive cash flow in a couple of years.  But the global coronavirus pandemic has thrown a huge spanner in the works.  Sweeping restrictions on work, travel and social distancing aimed at preventing the spread of the virus are putting both WeWork and SoftBank under enormous pressure.  WeWork is suffering, as major cities where it operates shut down for weeks on end. It still has to pay long-term leases, even if businesses squeezed by the outbreak cancel contracts with the shared office space company.  While SoftBank's planned stock buyout wouldn't have provided WeWork with any additional cash, the startup will lose out on $1.1 billion in debt financing that was contingent on the deal closing, according to a letter WeWork sent to investors last week, a copy of which was shared with CNN Business. SoftBank and its Vision Fund have committed more than $14.25 billion to WeWork to date, including $5.45 billion since October 2019. The coronavirus pandemic poses a catastrophic threat for many of the startups CEO Son has plowed money into through the $100 billion Vision Fund. In an effort to rescue SoftBank's plummeting share price, Son last week made the surprise announcement of what amounts to a fire sale of $41 billion worth of assets to buy back shares and reduce the company's heavy debt load.",4/3/2020

""As uncertainties arise from the global economic fallout of COVID-19, global growth may worsen before improving and market volatility and risk aversion will persist,"" Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at JP Morgan, said in a note on Friday.   US stock futures pointed lower, following an upbeat day on Wall Street. Dow (INDU) futures fell 255 points, or 1.2%. S&P 500 (SPX) futures were down about 1.18% and Nasdaq (COMP) futures fell about 1.2%.  After markets in Asia closed, the People's Bank of China announced that it will reduce the amount of cash that banks have to keep in reserve, freeing up 400 billion yuan ($56.3 billion) to ""revive the economy."" The reserve requirement ratio was also cut in March, injecting around 550 billion yuan ($77.5 billion) into the economy.  China is struggling to recover from the sudden economic shock caused by the pandemic. The World Bank warned earlier this week that its $14 trillion economy may not grow at all in 2020.  Oil rebound boosts stocks Stocks closed Thursday higher, driven by energy companies, which shot up after oil prices soared by a record 25%. President Donald Trump suggested that massive production cuts could be on the way, and Saudi Arabia said it was calling an urgent meeting of OPEC and other producers.  Oil prices continued their advance overnight, with Brent crude futures, the world's benchmark, rising more than 4% to $31.14 a barrel. US oil rose about 0.9% to $25.42. The oil market has suffered from collapsing demand amid the coronavirus crisis, with thousands of planes grounded and motorists staying home. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in a price war, flooding the market with additional supply.  Thursday's stock market gains came despite the highest initial jobless claims report in American history, as coronavirus forces a growing number of businesses to shutter and lay off or furlough employees. Around 6.6 million people filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended March 28 — more than the previous record of 3.3. million initial clams in the prior week — bringing the total number of initial jobless claims filed in March to more than 10 million.  And the spread of the coronavirus outbreak is not letting up. There are now more than 1 million cases of the virus globally, with more than 238,000 in the United States.  The US jobs report for March will be out Friday, although it is expected to be outdated given that the survey was done in the week ending March 12, before the tsunami of layoffs.  ""The data will be bad, in short, but not reflective of the true awfulness that is unfolding,"" Kit Juckes, chief strategist at Societe Generale, said in a note. ",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/investing/banks-small-business-lending-stimulus-coronavirus/index.html,Banks were the problem in 2008. They can help this time,"Since then, banks have become much more financially responsible, thanks to a combination of more stringent rules and regulations and smarter business practices.  As a result, financial firms may be the ones to help keep the economy afloat now that it's tanking a dozen years later due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Loans to small businesses in particular will be key, and experts say banks will need to augment the efforts that Washington has already put into place through the Small Business Administration's new Paycheck Protection Program. ""Unlike 2008, banks are not part of the problem. And they will be a big part of the solution,"" said Dan Genter, CEO of Genter Capital Management, an investment firm that owns shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Truist (TFC) -- the new bank formed from the merger of BB&T and SunTrust. Banks need to act quickly to prop up small business ""The SBA can't handle all the loan volume that will be needed. The only way to meet the demand is for the banks to lend more,"" Genter added. Several large banks have already started.  Goldman Sachs (GS) unveiled a $300 million aid package Thursday, which includes $250 million in emergency loans for small businesses. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in a CNBC interview Wednesday its small business bankers are fielding questions around the clock, including weekends, from merchant customers. And Citi is doing most of this digitally so small business owners need not leave their homes. ""We don't want to have people having to come out, so we're making sure that we've got the digital interface set up so that people can apply online,"" Corbat said. ""We can turn this money and get it into small business hands as quickly as we can."" CNN Business reached out to several other large banks to find out what they are doing to help. Truist told CNN Business that it has a $2 million commitment set aside to support small businesses affected by the pandemic. ""For our small business clients, we're here to help. We're offering numerous relief options, including deferred loan payments and fee waivers to help support short-term operating capital needs, as well as a special loan program without bank fees or closing costs,"" a Truist spokesman said. Flexibility is key for banks working with small businesses TD Bank (TD) said it is doing what it can for its small business customers,  too. A spokeswoman said that it is offering refunds of monthly maintenance and overdraft fees, waiving several monthly service fees and providing ""flexibility"" on paying back existing loans due to any hardship as a result of the coronavirus. It also plans to make Paycheck Protection Program loans as well. ""TD Bank is committed to helping our business customers during this trying time,"" the spokeswoman said, adding that it will ""provide loans for businesses to cover payroll, employee benefits, mortgage interest, utilities, rent and interest on other debts. PNC (PNC) said that it is working with small business customers that are struggling and will offer some ""the ability to postpone payments for a period of time"" and ""a range of modification options with no late fee."" It also plans to take part in the SBA's PPP. A spokesman for US Bancorp (USB) said the company is reducing the rate on certain short-term small business loans by as much as 2%, waiving fees on businesses receiving digital payments via Zelle and cutting rates on lines of credit. ""We recognize many small business owners have been hard hit by COVID-19,"" the US Bancorp spokesman said.  And a Wells Fargo (WFC) spokesman told CNN Business that ""we are committed to supporting our small business customers in a variety of ways, including payment relief for up to 90 days, fee waivers, payment deferrals, increases to lines of credit...and other expanded assistance for deposits."" Wells Fargo will make loans through the SBA PPP as well.  ""Our customers are experiencing challenges during the COVID-19 crisis and we want to help during these unprecedented times,"" the Wells Fargo spokesman said.  More help is needed -- now But some think banks and other financial firms must do even more to help keep small businesses afloat. ""Financials can provide loans but they may need more to do than that. The situation is dire and severe,"" said Guy Goldstein, CEO of Next Insurance, an online broker that caters to small businesses. Next Insurance did a survey of 1,000 small businesses two weeks ago and found that only 34% of them felt they were prepared for the current crisis while 41% have already begun to cut expenses. That's one reason why Goldstein said his firm has cut monthly premiums for small business customers and is giving back some money to companies who already paid for annual coverage. ""The impact from the coronavirus will have a lasting effect on the small business economy,"" said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg in a report Thursday.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/media/coronavirus-uk-media-briefings/index.html,'Complete waste of time.' UK media slam government coronavirus briefings ,"But some of the UK government's biggest cheerleaders are now tearing into it over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, slamming confusing and conflicting messaging from senior members of Johnson's cabinet.   In the crosshairs: The government's daily press conferences and the lack of a clearly articulated plan for boosting coronavirus testing capabilities. Only 2,000 frontline health care workers have so far been tested. While the daily Downing Street briefings were initially conducted with reporters in person, they've been held virtually for more than a week because of strict social-distancing rules. Reporters have to take part via video chat, making it harder for them to interrupt or challenge government ministers with followup questions.  Most striking is ferocious criticism from The Telegraph, a supporter of the Conservative Party, Johnson's former employer and the one newspaper he could normally rely on to boost his government no matter the situation.  Telegraph political columnist Michael Deacon has turned his fire on the ministers now routinely handling the press conferences since Johnson was forced into self isolation last Friday after he tested positive for coronavirus. Deacon's column on Wednesday called the briefings ""pathetic"" and ""a complete waste of time.""  ""People need clarity and candor. This evening, all they got was 24 minutes of the most pitiful, dispiriting waffle,"" he wrote of the most recent press conference, lead by Business Secretary Alok Sharma. The front page of Thursday's Telegraph was no kinder. Under a banner headline ""Questions without answers"" atop of a photo of Sharma, the Telegraph excoriated the government for being ""unable to answer basic questions"" about increasing testing capabilities.  Citing former health ministers and medical experts calling the government's handling ""ridiculous,"" the paper said the government was releasing scant details on a five-point plan to tackle the testing crisis.  Andrew Neil, chairman of the Spectator, another Conservative-leaning publication, called the press conference on Wednesday ""particularly uninformative,"" with ""far too much waffle and obfuscation."" The Daily Mail, also a Conservative-booster, lambasted the government in its own blaring cover story, saying ""Mail demands ministers FIX TESTING FIASCO NOW.""   ""By a country mile, the greatest misstep of this government in cracking the virus has been the shambles over mass testing,"" the paper's editorial board wrote. ""Mr. Johnson says he is exasperated by the slow progress. Welcome to how the rest of the nation feels!"" Opposition party officials have even taken to citing the Mail, not a typical ally, in a clear sign the government's communication strategy is failing.  Shami Chakrabarti, Labour's top spokesperson on legal affairs, called for the government to be more transparent and clear in its communications. ""What the Daily Mail is now calling the testing scandal or shambles is an example of a lack of both clarity of what the plan is and how it is going to be executed,"" she told BBC radio.",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/economy/hotel-industry-coronavirus/index.html,Hotel industry says it will struggle to get by even with government help,"His company, Vision Hospitality Group, owns 37 hotels in six states and it had seen record business in January and February, according to Patel. Things were going so well, he was planning to open two more hotels this year, and seven next year.  But then, in early March, Patel met with executives from Marriott, the brand many of his hotels operate under, to discuss business. China came up. The hotel business there had plummeted amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""We were saying 'that is awful,' and 'thank God that that's not the situation -- or what we expect -- in this country,'"" Patel recalled. ""And then Friday the 13th came."" That was the Friday when President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in the fight against the coronavirus, which had already been designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Cancellation reports from Patel's hotels started escalating and turned dire. For March, April and May, the projected occupancy sank below 10%.  ""We were in denial. We were in shock. It was almost surreal,"" he said.  Patel has since had to furlough 1,100 of his 1,500 employees. ""That's really broken my heart. Every day I get up and I think about 'how can I bring my people back?'."" A nightmare for hotels Coronavirus has devastated the hospitality industry, forcing hotels to take drastic steps to survive. Marriott  (MAR)has said it's seen cancellations at historic highs, forcing the company to furlough thousands of workers. The Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), which owns the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel brands among others, said that demand for rooms is the lowest it's ever seen.  Hotel room occupancy rates for the week of March 24th to the 30th fell 67.5% when compared to the same week in 2019, according to the hospitality analytics firm Smith Travel Group. There have been mass furloughs and layoffs across the industry. Many executives have given up their salaries or taken pay cuts. Some hotels have closed temporarily. Others, like Patel's, are staying open with a skeleton staff. Chip Rogers, CEO of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, expects that over the next month about half of hotels in the US will shut down temporarily to weather the coronavirus outbreak, and half will remain open with small teams. An Oxford Economics study conducted for AHLA found that 44% of hotel employees are likely to lose their jobs.  And while the $2 trillion financial stimulus package will help, Rogers said it's far from enough. ""It's a short-term preservation package that can carry the industry for a couple of months,"" Rogers said. ""But if you get to June and people aren't traveling again, then the problem we have today will be much worse.""  The CARES Act limits loans to 250% of average monthly payroll, which will be enough only to meet payroll and debt obligations for four to eight weeks, according to Rogers. His group believes hotels need more financial support, and he said lobbying is ongoing for an additional stimulus package to help hotels with their debts.  Exactly how much is needed is unclear, and depends on how quickly revenue returns. Rogers also said a stimulus will be needed once the virus passes, to encourage people to get out and travel again. In the meantime, he's encouraging hotels to talk to their mortgage lenders and adjust their payment schedules. Rogers said that banks have been good so far about offering flexibility on payments. Patel, for example, said that most banks are offering 90-day deferrals, and some 180 days. Patel hopes to slowly ramp his businesses back up in 90 days, as travel restrictions hopefully lift and people become more comfortable with traveling. But he doesn't expect business will return to 2019 levels for three or four years. Patel pointed to projections from Smith Travel Group, which expects 2020 revenue per room for the hotel industry to fall 50.6%. Those are deeper losses than what the industry faced after 9/11 and the 2008 recession. Patel expects that many hotels won't survive. ""When this has been lifted, please go out and travel and eat and let's be Americans again,"" Patel said. ""But only when it's safe.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/food-supply-chains-coronavirus/index.html,Can't find what you want in the grocery store? Here's why,"Food supply chains in developed economies are showing increased signs of strain as nationwide lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus heap pressure on systems that had very little slack to begin with. The result is empty store shelves, and panicked buyers.  The transportation links that move food around the globe are being tested in unprecedented ways. Shipowners are struggling to change crews and move goods between ports. Airlines have grounded thousands of planes, slashing air freight capacity.  Travel restrictions also are clogging up road networks and making it difficult for farm workers to get where they are needed. And at the end of food supply chains, supermarkets that have come to rely on just-in-time deliveries have been upset by huge demand and panic buying. Global stocks of staple commodities such as wheat, corn and rice are at healthy levels, said Maximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. But logistics bottlenecks need to be identified and resolved quickly to ensure goods can get to where they are needed, and protectionist policies avoided, he added.  Kazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, temporarily banned shipments of buckwheat, rye flour, sugar, carrots and potatoes earlier in March because the government was worried about domestic supply. While the restrictions have since been eased, similar moves by other countries could be problematic. The food supply crunch is getting attention from top policymakers: Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies last week pledged to resolve disruptions to global supply chains and ensure the movement of vital medical supplies, critical agricultural products and other goods and services across borders.   Shipping on the front line Shipping would be a good place to start. The vast majority of the world's food supply is carried on ships, either in containers or on board bulk carriers. Yet shipowners, already reeling from shutdowns of some of the world's busiest ports in China, are now having to contend with sweeping lockdowns all over the world, hindering access to ports and making crew changes all but impossible due to travel restrictions. Maersk (AMKAF), the world's largest container shipping company, recently said it had suspended all crew changes for a month partly to minimize the risk of vessels being quarantined by port authorities and causing disruptions to customers' cargo.  But doing so puts the physical and mental health of seafarers at risk, as they remain on board ships for extended periods without a break, which could lead to crew shortages later on, the International Chamber of Shipping has warned. More than 30 ports worldwide are either restricting entry to vessels or prohibiting crew changes, including in Australia, Vietnam, India, Greece, Portugal, Chile and Argentina, according to Wilhelmsen, a maritime industry conglomerate based in Norway. Rules governing port access differ from country to country, and sometimes even within countries, making it very difficult for shipowners to plan routes, said Guy Platten, secretary general at the International Chamber of Shipping. This could snarl food supply chains, particularly for time-sensitive fresh produce, he added.  Delays in transit from ports in China are likely to cause apple juice shortages in the United States, according to a March 13 report by commodities research firm Mintec. Two-thirds of the apple juice Americans drink comes from China.  Air cargo restricted The shutdown in commercial aviation caused by coronavirus has sharply reduced air cargo capacity, making it harder and more expensive to move perishable goods that need to be delivered at speed. ""Passenger operations have been reduced so drastically that there is just not the capacity in the system to meet even the reduced levels of air cargo,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement on Tuesday. Shipments have been delayed as airlines struggle to arrange crews and get permission to fly because of travel restrictions, de Juniac said. ""Last week the European Commission published guidance which will help clear roadblocks in Europe. And we encourage other countries to follow suit,"" he added. Hiten Dodhia, a director of Saturnalia UK, a company that imports high-value fresh produce from Africa and South America and sells it to supermarkets in Europe, said there has been a huge hike in the price of air freight due to the grounding of so many passenger planes.  Lockdowns and curfews in countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala and Peru are restricting the movement of workers and causing labor shortages on farms, which will obstruct planting, harvesting and packaging, he told CNN Business.  The biggest problems lie with vegetables that are planted, harvested and shipped over relatively short time frames, such as mangetout, sugar snaps, baby corn, beans and tenderstem broccoli, Dodhia said. He has told some farmers not to plant because it is unclear whether their goods can be moved to market in time. Labor and logistics Labor shortages in Europe and the United States also threaten to seriously disrupt supply chains, push food prices higher and make certain high-value commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, hard to find.  Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned that travel restrictions could prevent migrant workers from getting into the country for the upcoming harvest, while a nationwide shutdown will hamper growers' ability to recruit the 80,000 seasonal workers needed this year.  ""We are urging the British people, university students, anyone looking for work, to mobilize behind British growers in this time of national importance and pick for Britain,"" the union's vice president, Tom Bradshaw, said in a statement.  Labor shortages in Europe are meanwhile likely to interrupt Britain's supply of imported fruit and vegetables in the coming months, according to the UK's Landworkers' Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 small British farms and is a member of the international smallholder farmers' movement La Via Campesina. ""Much of our produce comes from Southern Europe, where producers are already delaying and reducing spring plantings due to restrictions on movement of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, illness, transport restrictions and cashflow,"" it said in a statement. The price of apples from Poland and broccoli from Spain jumped by roughly 20% between February and March, as consumers hoarded fruit and vegetables, according to Mintec. ""Traffic chaos at the German-Polish border has made transporting apples and other fruits problematic,"" said Mintec. Governments must resolve bottlenecks and ensure that perishable goods do not go to waste, said Torrero Cullen. Keeping labor-intensive packaging plants running at full capacity while still following social distancing guidelines will create an additional challenge, he added. No slack in the system Supermarkets, which are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked amid panic buying, are facing logistics headaches of their own. And just-in-time supply chains mean there is very little slack in the system.  Retailers generally hold between one to three weeks' worth of non-perishable items, such as pasta and rice, in stores and depots, with much lower quantities of fresh produce kept in storage, said Dave Howorth, executive director of Scala, an independent supply chain consultancy to the UK's food and drink sector.  ""Suppliers generally deliver on a daily basis because there's so little stock in the system,"" he added. But if shipments are delayed because of restricted access to ports, or suppliers are held up at border crossings, daily deliveries may not be possible. Photos of empty shelves and steps taken by retailers to ration purchases suggest that while there may be plenty of food out there, the systems that get it to where it's needed are being stretched.  This prompted the UK government to temporarily relax competition laws earlier in March to allow supermarkets to exchange data on stock levels, pool staff to meet demand, and share distribution depots and delivery vans.  Another factor driving demand at supermarkets: restrictions imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus mean that people are eating more at home, instead of in restaurants. ""It's a fundamental change. You've seen a significant switch in volumes, which has been overlaid with panic buying,"" said Howorth. Over the four weeks to March 21, UK shoppers made three additional trips to the grocery store compared to the same period last year, spending an extra £1.9 billion ($2.4 billion), according to Nielsen. An additional 1.2 million online orders were placed over the same period, the research firm said. ",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks/index.html,Coronavirus may be upending the rules of the global oil game,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. US oil prices soared before closing with a record single-day record gain of 25%. Why such enthusiasm? Russia and Saudi Arabia are locked in a brutal price war, and coordinated production cuts could soak up excess supply and boost prices. Trump, who needs prices to rise significantly to prevent a wave of bankruptcies among US shale producers, got what he wanted. But there were reasons to question the veracity of what the president tweeted.  Problem 1: Trump said he had just spoken to his friend, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the Kremlin denied that such a phone call had taken place.  Problem 2: The American president said that he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production by as many as 10 million barrels per day, and potentially up to 15 million barrels per day. But the lower end of that range is equal to all of Saudi Arabia's production. The big picture? Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in their price war since early March, flooding the oil market with cheap crude just as demand is cratering because of the coronavirus pandemic. Crude has crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks. Many analysts are skeptical that Russia and Saudi Arabia are ready to set aside their differences, especially with so many US shale producers under extreme pressure from low oil prices. But the coronavirus pandemic may be changing the rules of the game  ""Russia's objective was to hurt US shale,"" said Stephen Innes, the chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp. ""Well, that's all fine and dandy when Covid-19 was thought to be a brief health scare, but now the virus's economic hit is morphing into the most significant ... since the 'Great Depression.'"" What happens next: OPEC will hold an emergency meeting Monday, called by Saudi Arabia, according to two senior sources at OPEC. Other producers who are not OPEC members will be invited to the meeting, the sources said. The question is whether OPEC and allied producers will agree to resume production cuts, and if so, at what scale. Some analysts think Russia won't agree to cut without a similar commitment from the United States. US participation in coordinated production cuts would be ... tricky. Doing so runs counter to the country's free market ethos, and it's not clear whether the president would have legal authority to order hundreds of producers to limit their output. Then again, coronavirus may be changing the rules of the game. Some US oil producers have urged officials in Texas to impose caps on the state's oil production. The Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state's energy industry, hasn't exercised that power in more than 40 years. Ryan Sitton, a commissioner at the regulator, said Thursday he had a ""great conversation"" with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in which they discussed the need to remove 10 million barrels per day from global supply. Prices continued to advance Friday, recovering some of the massive plunge seen over the past month. Brent crude futures, the world's benchmark, were trading more than 6% higher at $31.56 a barrel. Stay tuned: Trump is meeting with US oil producers on Friday. Putin is meeting the heads of major Russian energy companies. The US jobs market is under huge pressure The past three weeks have marked one of the most devastating periods in history for the American job market. The chart shown above is almost unbelievable — it shows that 6.6 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, double the previous record. On Friday, new data showed the US economy shed 701,000 jobs in March. It was the first monthly jobs loss since September 2010, and much worse than analysts had expected. The unemployment rate moved up to 4.4%, from a near 50-year low of 3.5%.  Big picture: The March report's drop in jobs ""will likely be dwarfed by job losses closer to 10 million in April, with the unemployment rate rising above 10%,"" economists at Citi said in a research note. The next jobs report is due on May 8, and will be a far better measure of the pandemic's impact. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, said the unemployment rate could soar as high as 30%. ""Sadly we're only at the start of this process. There are around 18 million jobs, mostly in the service sector, at risk from social distancing,"" said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. Get ready for wartime levels of national debt  Governments are launching one rescue package after another in hopes of preventing economic catastrophe as the coronavirus pandemic rampages around the world. In most countries, political opposition to spending increases funded by borrowing has vanished in the face of a potential global depression. But the trillions of dollars in support promised to households and businesses will push up budget deficits to their highest levels since the global financial crisis. In the United States, the wave of stimulus spending could push debt as a share of the economy to levels not seen since the end of the World War II.  Spending increases and tax cuts have already pushed US government debt up to $17 trillion, doubling the country's debt to GDP ratio to nearly 80% since 2008. According to Commerzbank, the coronavirus relief packages approved so far will push that figure to 96% by 2022. ""Should Congress pass further aid packages and should the economic damage be greater than previously assumed, the previous record set in 1946 (106%) could be surpassed,"" Bernd Weidensteiner, one of the German bank's economists, wrote recently.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/chevron-dividend-stock-oil/index.html,Chevron CEO vows to avoid first dividend cut since Great Depression,"Facing $25 oil prices and a stock price that has been cut in half, America's second-largest oil company is also considering laying off workers.  But there's one thing Chevron (CVX) won't touch: its coveted dividend. Even as other storied companies slash their payouts to brace for a looming recession, 140-year-old Chevron insists its dividend will survive the oil crash unscathed.   ""Our financial priorities remain intact. And the dividend is at the top of that list of priorities,"" Chevron CEO Michael Wirth told CNN Business on Tuesday. ""Our shareholders depend on that dividend.""  Chevron, which traces its roots to 1879, hasn't cut its dividend since 1932 during the Great Depression. In late January, Chevron boosted its dividend by 8%, marking the 33rd straight year of increases.  But the world is a very different place today. The coronavirus pandemic has shut down large parts of the global economy, setting the stage for a deep recession. Passenger planes have been grounded. Highways are empty. And factories have gone dark. All of that is causing an unprecedented decline in oil demand.   At the same time, Saudi Arabia and Russia are in the middle of an epic price war that is flooding the market with supply at the worst possible time.   Protecting the dividend at all costs Against that uncertain backdrop, a slew of major companies have cut or even abandoned their dividends.  Boeing (BA) suspended its dividend Monday for the first time in nearly 80 years. Ford (F) suspended its dividend last week.  Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) similarly suspended its dividend this week. Debt-riddled oil giant Occidental Petroleum  (OXY)slashed its dividend by 86% earlier this month.   Goldman Sachs predicted earlier this month that the biggest oil companies, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, will avoid dividend cuts because they no longer need high oil prices to break even.  ""Big Oils enter this downturn stronger and more resilient,"" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report to clients.   Still, Chevron is aiming to slash its expenses by $1 billion. Wirth said the company is moving forward with a restructuring plan that began long before the oil crash. He added that Chevron has not ""finalized"" specific numbers around potential layoffs.   Russia's oil war against America Like many of its peers, Chevron is reining in spending, including in the Permian Basin, the West Texas epicenter of America's shale oil boom. Chevron is slashing its Permian spending by $2 billion, resulting in 20% less production there at the end of 2020 than previously expected.   In many ways, that's exactly what Russia and Vladimir Putin wanted when they refused earlier this month to cut production despite the coronavirus shock. The goal is to recapture market share by drowning American frackers in a sea of cheap crude.  ""I don't know what Russia wanted,"" the Chevron CEO said. ""They didn't phone me up and tell me.""  Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, responded by slashing prices and promising to ramp up production. US crude crashed to an 18-year low at $20 a barrel last week.  Although other oil executives like shale billionaire Harold Hamm have accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of ""taking advantage"" of the pandemic to ""attack"" US energy companies, Wirth signaled he's moving on.  ""I don't have time to point fingers or get frustrated with things I can't control,"" Wirth said. ""We can't control oil markets or what other countries choose to do.""  Bailouts, production caps Facing a wave of potential oil bankruptcies, earlier this month the Trump administration considered providing federal assistance to the shale industry.   But Chevron, like the oil lobby it is a member of, is rejecting calls for a rescue like the ones in the works for the airline, aerospace and travel industries.   ""We're not in favor of bailouts,"" Wirth said.   Some oil CEOs have also urged Texas to restrict the state's oil production, something regulators there haven't done in more than 40 years. The goal would be to ease the crushing oil gut by putting a limit on the biggest source of supply.  Yet such a cap would go against the oil industry's free-market ethos -- and could backfire by keeping alive inefficient companies.   ""We believe in free markets. We don't expect unique assistance from governments,"" Wirth said.  What if Chevron won the Anadarko bidding war? That's easy for a company the size of Chevron to say. It's the smaller drillers and the ones that took on excess debt that are most at risk.    Chevron very nearly added a great deal of risk to its empire last year. The company reached a deal in April to buy shale driller Anadarko Petroleum for $33 billion.  Days later, Occidental swooped in with a better offer. Chevron had the financial firepower to top that bid. Instead, it decided to walk away.   Today, Occidental is in turmoil because that deal required it to pile on debt -- just months before the collapse in prices. Fitch Ratings issued a rate triple downgrade of Occidental's credit rating, leaving it in junk territory.   ""We've moved on from that,"" Wirth said of the Anadarko bidding war. ""The market offers its own lessons. Anyone in this industry needs to be conscious of price discipline and capital discipline.""   Given where oil prices have plunged to, it increasingly looks like Chevron won that bidding war by losing it.  ",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/perspectives/government-action-coronavirus/index.html,Congress must act now to prevent an even worse economic crisis,"While that delay may have calmed some nerves and prevented a panicked sell-off, the stock market decline since then has been precipitous. Heavy losses have triggered subsequent market pauses, and significant stimulus packages from around the world have done little to calm investors' nerves.  The message from Wall Street is clear: Time for a solution has run out. We are now squarely in the midst of a health crisis, an economic crisis and a brewing, calamitous job crisis.  And yet, as I write, policymakers cannot agree on a desperately needed, decisive move to resuscitate an economy that is flatlining. Every day, the numbers become bleaker. On Monday, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, reaffirmed that a 30% unemployment rate in America is a realistic prospect. That's more than 47 million Americans out of work at a time when 40% of US households can't write a $400 check in an emergency. The underlying fragilities of the US economy have been revealed: Another Great Depression could be upon us. On Monday, the Fed pledged to buy bonds with no limits, created three new credit facilities and announced a Main Street lending program. Economists have talked a lot in recent weeks about the need to pull out the economic bazooka to fight this battle. Well, this was the entire arsenal.  The problem now is that, to continue the militaristic analogy, this fight needs real air cover -- and that must come from Congress. The stimulus package currently being debated in Washington needs to be all-in. There is simply no point in half measures at this stage. It might seem ridiculous to describe a possible $2 trillion package as a half measure, but that may be exactly what it is: If you look at the commitments made by countries, such as the UK and Germany, as a percentage of GDP, the US package will fall short. The key will be if they can somehow scale up the loans using financial leverage, then the scale of the lending capacity could be multiple times the size. We'll hopefully soon see. The US stimulus should not be considered a measure to prop up or bail out big business, but rather an investment in survival. The key is giving small- and medium-sized businesses and private individuals the confidence to know that they need not fire people, or that their jobs are safe in the short term. That's where 85% of employment in the US resides. They need to know that no matter what, the government won't saddle them with debt.   That means the government needs to deliver grants with as few strings attached as possible. Only that will bring the certainty everyone is craving so desperately for in this most uncertain of times. Immediate cash infusions to ordinary people and a suspension of debt payments and utilities -- as some states have already done -- would also help. When industries, such as travel and hotels, are reporting as many as 70% of workers are either furloughed or laid off already, the sense of urgency and the need for decisive, massive intervention is clear. President Donald Trump has been widely criticized for taking his time at the outset of this crisis, but now both Democrats and Republicans are slowing things down as they try to lever broader political objectives into the deal.  There will be a time and place for political debates, and these questions must be addressed; but the survival of individuals and workers for the next two to three months should be the priority now, when every second counts, and every delay costs.  None of us is sure how long this economic decline will last, but immediate action is nevertheless critical. A time will come when the pain inflicted by the cure -- on jobs, livelihoods and people's futures -- outweighs the pain of the health crisis itself. The time may come when policymakers have to loosen the restrictions and let the economy breathe again, while protecting only the most vulnerable. Those painful decisions are coming, and perhaps the only chance we have to avert them is for the politicians here to act, and act now.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/retail-furloughs-coronavirus/index.html,Half a million Americans were furloughed by major department stores this week,"Stores are closed and online sales are slow because people are holding back on discretionary purchases like clothing. It's anyone's guess when stores will be able to reopen or if demand will return when they do. That has forced major companies like Macy's, Kohl's, Gap and JCPenney to put roughly half a million people, ranging from hourly associates to corporate employees, on furlough this week.  In another effort to preserve money and in a show of solidarity, some of these companies have slashed pay for their executives and paused bonuses or raises this year. If there's some good news for the affected employees, it's that several of these companies are still providing healthcare.  Ascena The owner of Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant announced Monday it made the ""extremely difficult decision"" to furlough all of its store associates and half of its corporate employees. That amounts to roughly 40,000 employees, according to figures from a regulatory filing. Ascena's (ASNA) remaining corporate employees will have their salaries reduced by as much as 45%.  Gap Inc. Gap (GPS), which owns Old Navy and Athleta, said Tuesday it was putting 80,000 store employees and some of its corporate employees on furlough.  The company also said in a press release that Gap executives and its board are taking a ""temporary reduction in pay,"" although it declined to say how much. JCPenney The department store said in a statement Tuesday that it has made the ""difficult decision to temporarily furlough the majority of store hourly associates."" JCPenney (JCP) also said that a ""significant portion"" of its corporate employees will be placed on leave. It had about 90,000 employees as of February 1. Kohl's Discount department store Kohl's (KSS) said Monday it was furloughing workers at its stores and distribution centers, as well as some corporate employees. That amounts to roughly 85,000 employees, according to a spokesperson. Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass isn't taking a salary for the time being. Macy's Macy's (M) said Monday it was furloughing a ""majority"" of its 125,000 employees. The company said that the coronavirus has taken a ""heavy toll"" on its business, leading it to temporarily close its roughly 775 stores. The changes also affect Bloomingdale's and makeup retailer Bluemercury.  Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette and the company's board of directors will stop receiving their salaries, according to a regulatory filing. Neiman Marcus A ""large portion"" of the luxury department stores' 14,000 employees are being placed on furlough. CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck said he's not taking his salary while employees are on furlough, and his direct reports are also waiving a ""significant amount"" of their salaries.  Urban Outfitters The trendy retailer was one of the first companies to shut its doors. Urban Outfitters (URBN) said Tuesday that a ""substantial number of store, wholesale and home office employees"" will be put on furlough.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/car-sales-coronavirus/index.html,Car sales are plunging in the US because of coronavirus,"Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) announced Wednesday that its first-quarter sales in the United States fell by 10% even though sales were up the first two months of the quarter. ""Strong momentum in January and February was more than offset by the negative economic impact of the coronavirus in March,"" said the company. General Motors (GM) reported a 7% drop in sales for the quarter, which it attributed to the sharp decline in March sales because of the virus outbreak.  Neither company would release the month-by-month sales figures. But Toyota (TM) reported results for both March and the quarter. Its daily sales pace plunged 32% in March, while its overall sales in the month fell 37%, hurt in addition by one fewer sales day in the month. Overall, its first-quarter sales fell 9%, similar to the declines reported at Ford and GM. So it's possible that Ford and GM suffered a similar decline in March to what Toyota reported. Many other automakers are due to report March or first-quarter sales Wednesday or Thursday. But none are likely to report good sales said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Cox Automotive. ""What did save them is that March started out pretty well, but then it fell off a cliff,"" said Krebs. Numerous factors are working against car sales. Top among those factors is that more than three-quarters of Americans live in states or cities where they are being told to stay at home except for essentials such as shopping for food, drugs or seeking medical care. In addition, many potential buyers are suffering economic setbacks because of the businesses they work for or own being closed. More than 3 million people recently filed for unemployment benefits, a record for one week. And that has frozen a lot of potential buyers out of the credit market because of their job or economic situation, Krebs said. ""The three things that most determine car sales are credit, employment and consumer confidence,"" she said. ""All are working against car sales. April is going to be even worse."" Fiat Chrysler responded with the most aggressive sales incentives yet on the market. The offer, rolled out Wednesday, allows eligible buyers to get a seven-year interest-free loan with payments deferred for 90 days. But buyers still need to qualify for the loan. The company said it is now offering a new online purchase option that allows buyers to purchase a vehicle off a dealer lot, conduct a vehicle trade-in process, apply for credit, receive price and payment estimates and review service protection plan options.  Most dealerships remain open, according to Fiat-Chrysler, but there are some states where dealerships have been ordered to close, Krebs said. About 37% people surveyed by Cox Automotive say they will wait going to a dealership, even for servicing on their car, because of health concerns. So the drop in car sales will probably continue, no matter the incentives that are offered, said Krebs. In addition to the economic headwinds, millions of additional workers who are still on the job are working from home, reducing their need for a car to commute to work or get children to school or other activities that have also been canceled. Another factor working against car sales is the recent stock market turmoil that hurt many people's savings, which can also reduce the willingness of people to purchase a big-ticket item like a new car. But if sales have ground to a near halt, so has the supply of vehicles for dealerships.  Virtually all automakers have halted production of new cars and trucks, as 97% of auto plants in North America and Europe have shut operations, according to research firm GlobalData. Automakers such as Ford (F), which stated plans to restart production in April, now say they have no definitive date for when they will be able to build cars again.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/investing/dividends-coronavirus-recession/index.html,The next hit to your retirement fund: Disappearing dividends,"Banks have already started ditching payments worth billions of dollars, and so have companies in other industries. The cuts are a sign of just how big a hit the coronavirus has been for global businesses, which delivered a record $1.4 trillion in dividends last year.  ""We're getting companies suspending or cutting dividends every single day at the moment,"" said Jane Shoemake, investment director on the global equity income team at Janus Henderson, an asset manager that tracks global dividends. Goldman Sachs estimates that S&P 500 (DVS) dividends will decline by 25% this year. Citigroup, meanwhile, thinks dividends in Europe — which are typically more generous than in the United States — could be cut in half. Pressure to slice dividends is coming from many sources: In the United States, companies that accept federal bailouts or loans to survive the coronavirus crisis are barred from paying dividends in the near term, while regulators are calling on banks to preserve capital so they can keep lending to businesses and offer mortgage holidays to households. UK banks including HSBC (HBCYF), Standard Chartered (SCBFF) and Lloyds (LLDTF) have halted dividend payments following a request from the country's financial services regulator. Their shares plunged on Wednesday, pushing the FTSE 100 (UKX) index down more than 3%. For the retail, hospitality and energy sectors — which have seen revenue dry up completely in some places — it's about holding onto enough cash to tide them over until the lockdowns lift and the economy can start to recover. ""It's all about the balance sheet right now,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. A looming 'wave' of cuts Dividend payments have exploded since the global financial crisis as steady economic growth and President Donald Trump's corporate tax cut in 2017 left companies flush with cash. Executives binged on buying back shares and boosting dividends, which reward investors while boosting the value of the company's stock.  In 2019, dividend payments rose by 3.5% to hit $1.4 trillion, an all-time high, according to Janus Henderson.  Companies usually try to preserve those payments at all costs. Shareholders can be punishing if they backpedal. That's especially true in the oil sector, where dividends are the main prize keeping investors committed to an industry with limited opportunities for growth. But faced with an oil price crash, a sharp recession and the prospect of having to layoff or furlough employees, companies have few options but to retrench. Goldman Sachs strategists Cole Hunter and David Kostin told clients this week that ""a wave of dividend suspensions, cuts, and eliminations will result in payouts declining by 38% during the next nine months."" In Europe, dividends cuts could be even worse than during the global financial crisis, when they fell by a third, according to Citigroup strategist Robert Buckland. Under pressure Those hit the hardest by the pandemic have quickly moved to stop dividend payments in a bid to conserve cash. Carnival (CCL), which is trying to tap capital markets for $6 billion as the cruise industry implodes, halted its dividend on Tuesday.  Companies also have public opinion to consider at a moment when shareholder handouts are politically charged. Continuing to make dividend payments while cutting employees loose would pose a major reputational risk. ""To be seen to be paying out a big dividend when all of this is going on, it could not be taken very well,"" Janus Henderson's Shoemake said. Macy's (M) suspended its dividend on March 20 before announcing that it would furlough most of its 125,000 employees earlier this week. Access to government bailouts is a factor, too. Under the $2 trillion stimulus bill enacted by the United States last week, businesses that take advantage of a new $500 billion lending program can't issue dividends until a year after the loan has been repaid. Airlines that receive US assistance aren't permitted to make such payments through September.  The situation is slightly different for banks. Regulators have assured the public that lenders have the capital necessary to get them through the crash without sparking a new financial crisis. But they're encouraging banks to pause dividends anyway so they can boost lending, helping to power the economy through this vulnerable moment. The European Central Bank has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least October ""to boost banks' capacity to absorb losses and support lending to households, small businesses and corporates.""  UniCredit (UNCFF), Italy's top bank, quickly said it would fall in line. Big Oil holds out In the oil sector, where dividends are sacrosanct, the biggest players are doing their best to stay the course despite the 63% collapse in oil prices since early January. ""Through the last downturn they did whatever they could to avoid cutting their dividends,"" said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at the consultancy Palissy Advisors, referring to a plunge in oil prices between 2014 and 2016. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) hasn't slashed its dividend since World War II, and it's going to extraordinary lengths to avoid doing so now. The company said this week it has secured a $12 billion line of credit, which comes on top of a $10 billion credit facility obtained in December. But taking on more debt at such a precarious moment could be dangerous, and it's not an option for all oil companies, Kapadia said. They could reduce spending on equipment, but they already sold a lot of what they could during the last oil shock. If prices stay this low, the product of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and evaporating demand, cash levels could be low enough to force Big Oil's hand. ""As you go on through the year, the prospect of dividend cuts becomes much higher,"" Kapadia said. Some companies, such as those in tech, health care and utilities, will be less affected by the coronavirus outbreak and could stay the course. But in the current environment, it's hard to say which payouts are safe — especially when the outlook is so uncertain. ""Even companies that could pay dividends may not do so,"" Citigroup's Buckland said. ""Better to build cash on the balance sheet to deal with potential pitfalls ahead.""",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/economy/march-jobs-report-preview/index.html,America's labor market is hurting. But this jobs report won't show the worst of it,"In recent weeks, companies have been laying off thousands of employees throughout the country and across industries — with the hospitality, leisure and travel sectors hit hardest as Americans stopped traveling or even leaving their homes.  Now the focus turns to the March jobs report, due Friday at 8:30 am ET,  the first from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since COVID-19 began sweeping across America. Economists polled by Refinitiv expect a drop of 100,000 jobs in March, bringing the 10-year stretch of continuous increases in monthly job numbers to a screeching halt. It also would push the unemployment rate to 3.8%.  In comparison, the economy added 273,000 jobs in February, when the unemployment rate stood at 3.5%, near a 50-year low. The BLS surveys on which the jobs report is based were conducted in the second week in March, when the outbreak's impact on American businesses and workers was still muted. Since then, initial claims for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed. In the week ended March 21, nearly 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment. State labor departments are struggling to keep up with the onslaught of workers in need of government assistance. The March report's drop in jobs ""will likely be dwarfed by job losses closer to 10 million in April, with the unemployment rate rising above 10%,"" said economists at Citi in a note. The April jobs report is due on May 8, and will be a far better measure of the pandemic's impact on the labor market. Last week, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, said the unemployment rate could soar as high as 30%. ""Sadly we're only at the start of this process. There are around 18 million jobs, mostly in the service sector, at risk from social distancing,"" said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, in emailed comments. McCann thinks unemployment could climb as high as 12% overall.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/perspectives/economic-relief-bill/index.html,Nobel prize-winning economist: The relief package turned out better than I thought it would,"The first priority is to ensure that we have the right economics to protect our health — that's why assistance to hospitals and paid sick leave is so important. But beyond that we need to protect our citizens to prevent the extremes of deprivation and stress that would otherwise arise, and to put our economy on a sound footing for recovery once the pandemic is under control.  What the US economy needs is for the money to get into the right hands quickly and to keep workers linked to their employers.  In that respect, the bill rightly sought to strengthen the US unemployment insurance system, which is among the weakest in the advanced countries both in terms of coverage (the fraction of workers entitled to benefits) and replacement rates (benefits as a ratio of normal pay). If forecasts are correct, the burden on the unemployment insurance system will be enormous. The 3.3 million workers who registered for unemployment benefits last week increased the number of unemployed Americans by some 50% from the 5.8 million US workers  unemployed in February. And that latest number is likely low because some couldn't get through to the unemployment offices to register. Coverage for freelance workers and those in the gig economy is also an important part of the deal that will help make sure these people get much-needed support — but it will lead to unemployment benefit numbers increasing still further. Extending the period of coverage for unemployed workers and increasing payments will also be key provisions protecting the estimated 20% to 30% of the labor force that is likely to be unemployed.   The package also attempts to prevent people from falling through the cracks by providing $1,200 to individuals earning $75,000 or less or $2,400 to couples earning less than $150,000, although it does not go far enough to ensure financial stability for most Americans.  It was a fantasy for the Trump administration to suggest it could send the checks out in two weeks. It took two weeks to get legislation passed, and now the administration says it will take another three weeks for those funds to reach taxpayers for whom the IRS has the requisite data. It will take even longer for the rest. With so many Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, unable to cover a $400 emergency, this delay could be calamitous.   There is an urgency here: If families can't pay the landlords, and the landlords can't pay their bills, and so forth down the line, we could get a gridlocked economy that would be hard to start up in the future. I've seen this in other crises, and we don't want it here.     Given these problems, it was important that the legislation included provisions that many other countries have introduced — things like protection against eviction and foreclosure on homes with federal mortgages and a stay on interest payments on federal student debt.  But the legislation didn't go far enough: It should have included a stay on all evictions and mortgage foreclosures, credit cards and car repossessions. The stay for credit cards is especially important, given the high interest rates charged by credit card companies. Without it, many families will find themselves with unmanageable debt.   In addition to helping individuals, we must also sustain the economy and its financial system. Normal monetary and fiscal policy, while helpful, won't suffice because both supply and demand have been deeply perturbed. In 2008, monetary policy may have prevented the collapse of the banking system, but it didn't lead to a quick resuscitation of the economy.  So too here.   In 2008, the credit crunch came from the top down, from the bad behavior of the banks. Here it will come from the bottom up, because when people's income sources dry up, they won't be able to pay their bills, with cascading effects throughout the economy.  For this, we need more of a bottom-up response than in 2008.  The $1,200 checks will be vital. Small businesses will also need the variety of benefits that are included in the legislation, including deferrals on certain tax payments and SBA loan repayments, grants and low-interest loans.   Then there are the bailouts. Giving money to companies that squandered the opportunity to put money aside for a rainy day because they opted for massive share buybacks is not the way.  That's old-fashioned trickle-down economics, which has never worked.  We need to distinguish between bailing out companies and bailing out their shareholders and bondholders. I have argued that loans should take the form of convertible bonds with warrants, so taxpayers get adequate compensation for the risk they bear, and the interest should be linked to their past behavior — if they've put themselves in this position by share buybacks and if they've been a tax avoider.  And there should be conditions on this money based on employment, governance, the treatment of labor and the environment.   The Democrats succeeded in putting in restrictions on the behavior most likely to outrage citizens: taxpayer money being used to pay executives' exorbitant salaries or to buy back shares.  They have also prevented companies from taking the money and laying off workers. What is most lacking in the package is an adequate sense of prioritization. We've forgotten the first lesson of economics:  Because resources are scarce, we need to prioritize. Should we be rescuing luxury hotels when our states may not be able to maintain essential services? When our universities, hard hit by losses of endowments and threatened by declining enrollments from foreign students, may have to cut back, including in grants they give to poor students? Just because a sector is able and willing to pay for more lobbyists or make larger campaign contributions does not mean it is more deserving of assistance. While this is not perfect legislation, it's far better than I had thought it would be. Many of the measures originally proposed by the administration, like a payroll tax cut, wouldn't have done the trick.  That measure wouldn't have delivered money to where it's needed the most.  Little would have trickled down to the workers, and workers who have lost their jobs would have gotten nothing.  Even worse  it would have been another corporate profit tax cut. The 2017 cut didn't generate investment and didn't raise wages; it primarily led to almost a trillion dollars of share buybacks.   These measures won't save all the restaurants and other small businesses that are closed as part of the steps taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus; but, if we can mobilize quickly, it will save the millions of Americans who will have no sources of income from economic ruin,  it can stave off the bottom-up financial crisis that is likely to arise otherwise, and it will put us in a far better position for recovery once the pandemic has been conquered.   Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures, and these are extraordinary times.",4/2/2020

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/media/media-labor-unions-coronavirus/index.html,Coronavirus is testing the power of unionized newsrooms,"""Every single time I felt helpless,"" Sanders told CNN Business. ""There was nothing that I could do. I could go home and be angry. I could complain to my coworkers, but I had no power to make any kind of change to the situation."" But on Monday, after Sanders learned of Gannett's furlough plan — requiring employees making more than $38,000 to take five days unpaid in April, May and June —  she didn't feel helpless like she did in the past. The Arizona Republic is one of more than 30 unionized newsrooms under Gannett ownership, represented by the NewsGuild.  ""We deserve better than this. Having a union allows you to [ask for] that in a coordinated way. I would never know what's going on in Eugene, Oregon, Rochester, Jacksonville and Milwaukee, except that I have friends now in all of those newsrooms. We're all sharing information and talking about how we can best serve our journalists,"" Sanders said.  Over the last few years, a wave of unionization has swept local newsrooms and digital media outlets. As the coronavirus sweeps the country, forcing media companies to enact drastic cost-cutting plans, unionized newsrooms are putting the power of collective bargaining to the test.  NewsGuild's stimulus plan Action plans aren't just being formed within individual newsrooms. On Wednesday, the NewsGuild-CWA, which represents thousands of media workers in the US and Canada, called for public stimulus funds for the media industry, NewsGuild president Jon Schleuss told CNN Business. The plan, passed unanimously by the labor union's executive council, calls for federal, state, provincial and local governments to provide public funds to sustain newsrooms.  ""We're calling for a stimulus plan that would protect the fourth estate and protect the work because it's an essential service,"" Schleuss said. ""It's really about public health, and it's about trying to do this in the interest of our communities who are desperate for this information at this critical moment."" The stimulus plan has certain stipulations for employers who request public funds. For example, executives are not allowed to take bonuses, stock options or ""golden parachutes"" for five years. An executive's compensation also cannot be more than twice as much as that of an editor in chief's.  ""We entered the pandemic without enough people to cover this story [because] private equity and hedge funds have used [media] as a distressed asset situation to just take as much money as they can,"" Schleuss said. ""That's terrible for our communities."" Union protections Labor unions have gained traction at newspapers and digital media outlets in recent years as staffers witnessed round after round of layoffs even as traffic soared on some sites. This created unstable work environments that called for job protections, better benefits and severance packages. Thrillist staffers announced their intention to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East in early 2017 after approximately 20 employees were laid off. BuzzFeed voted to unionize in early 2019 after 15% of its workforce, or about 220 people, were laid off.  Other newsroom unions have existed for decades. The Knoxville Newspaper Guild, which includes staffers of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, formed in 1936. The Arizona Republic, meanwhile, voted to unionize in October, seeking workplace protections prior to the merger of newspaper conglomerates Gannett and GateHouse.  Gary White, union chair of the Gannett-owned Lakeland Ledger, told CNN Business that since the paper unionized in 2016, they have had two ""modest raises,"" frozen health care premiums, received two more personal days and secured ""just-cause protection, when previously management could fire employees at will."" Indeed, Gannett journalists said they have witnessed their newsrooms shrink drastically in recent years. Travis Dorman, union president of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, said his newsroom lost six reporters and only hired one over the last six months. Andrew Pantazi, union co-chair at the Florida Times Union Guild, said that since GateHouse bought the Jacksonville-based paper in 2017 the newsroom staff has dropped from 62 to 28 people.  Some unions have successfully pushed back against layoffs. Pantazi said his paper's union prevented two layoffs last year. Sanders of The Arizona Republic said they negotiated buyouts rather than layoffs at the end of last year.  ""One of the most affirming things about why this union effort was successful is one of our retirees on the last day went by every single desk in the newsroom saying goodbye,"" Sanders said. ""That maybe seems small in the scheme of things, but to give people the opportunity to leave on their own terms in an industry that is cratering is actually a pretty big deal.""  Unions during coronavirus  Since Monday's news, union chairs across Gannett newsrooms have been been in constant communication with each other through phone calls, Zoom video conference calls, texts, emails and Google Hangouts to discuss action plans. Initially, some unionized newsrooms were planning to bargain collectively. But according to two union chairs, Gannett declined the opportunity. Still, Gannett staffers are working together behind the scenes to plan their individual bargaining discussions with management and other tactics.  ""Journalists in some sense are the most ideal union members because we are trained to question authority, to research the data, to hold power to account and that's all we're doing,"" Sanders said.  Given the already shrunken staffs at newsrooms, Gannett reporters told CNN Business that they are fearful for the effects of the furloughs. Pantazi likened the plan to cut hours by 25% each month to reducing the amount of reporting by 25%. He worries that the cuts could spell trouble for communities hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  ""We're concerned that in the middle of a crisis we're going to see 25% less stories about how people can stay safe, how people can get tested as well as 25% less accountability of government organizations that have not been handling this crisis well and companies that have been exploiting this crisis,"" Pantazi said.  Though, not every staffer will be furloughed since the plan requires employees to make at least $38,000. Dorman of the Knoxville News-Sentinel said about little less than half his staff of 23 reporters and photographers make under $38,000, including himself. Austin White, union chair of the Pueblo Chieftain, said three out of eight reporters would not be furloughed and that these employees would not be eligible for overtime pay.  ""People are going to have to make up for other people's work that won't be there or just have a horrible output,"" White said. ""I don't understand how you can get away with no overtime."" A Gannett spokesperson told CNN Business that under the company's policies, furloughed employees could be eligible paid overtime as long as it is approved by their managers.  One concern union chairs have is Gannett's lack of due diligence in reviewing other cost-cutting options. For example, while Gannett CEO Paul Bascobert announced he would not take salary until the furloughs were over, there was no mention of the company's other CEO, Mike Reed, taking a pay cut.  A Gannett spokesperson said Reed is not employed by Gannett, but by Fortress Investment Group, the private equity firm in New York that manages the newly combined company. Sanders said she hopes to relax freelance restrictions, allowing furloughed staffers to write for other outlets as another source of income.  In the meantime, some papers have organized relief funds, and others are considering similar efforts. Pantazi said the Florida Times Union had raised about $10,000 as of Tuesday.  ""It's going to help our members if they do get any pay cuts to be able to make their rent, to be able to pay for their medicine, to be able to cover the expenses that they've been accruing,"" Pantazi said. ""That's going to help us take care of our coworkers, even as we continue to fight to have the least amount of reduction in reporting as possible.""",4/2/2020

Government data to be published at 8:30 a.m. ET will reveal just how much damage efforts to contain the pandemic have done to the US labor market.  Economists surveyed by Reuters estimate that 3.5 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week. Some Wall Street banks put the number even higher; Goldman Sachs (GS) predicts that a shocking 6 million Americans filed initial unemployment claims, nearly twice the record set during the previous week. Kevin Giddis, the chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James, said in a research note on Wednesday that investors are still getting to grips with a wave of sobering news about the coronavirus, and realizing the economic recovery may take much longer than expected.

"" Crude oil futures moved sharply higher on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to quickly end a price war that has put US shale producers under huge pressure.  US crude jumped 9% to trade at $22.20 a barrel. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, gained nearly 10% to trade at $27.01 a barrel.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/business/oil-crash-bankruptcies-whiting/index.html,A wave of oil bankruptcies is on the way,"Whiting Petroleum, once a rising star in the shale industry, filed for Chapter 11 protection Wednesday. The oil driller survived for years at $50-a-barrel oil. But the recent collapse to $20 proved unbearable, sparking the first major oil bankruptcy of the current crisis.   Whiting (WLL) surely won't be the last. The coronavirus pandemic has crushed the oil industry, setting off a swift and unprecedented decline in demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. That pain has been amplified by an epic price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, a mountain of debt on oil company balance sheets and the virtual shutdown of the junk bond market.   Those factors will almost surely set off a spike in oil patch bankruptcies in the coming months. And unlike the 2014-2016 oil crash, some of those companies may not survive.   ""There will be a wave of bankruptcy filings this year,"" said Spencer Cutter, credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.   Nearly 100 US oil and gas producers could file for Chapter 11 over the next year, according to Buddy Clark, co-chair of the energy practice at Houston law firm Haynes and Boone.   That would nearly match the total number of bankruptcies in 2015 and 2016 combined when oil prices crashed to $26 a barrel.   ""It's not just the guys that levered up in the mad rush of late 2010 to 2014 and put on way too much debt. Some of these companies are well structured,"" Clark said.  30% of junk energy bonds could default The obvious problem for the oil industry is US oil prices have plunged by two-thirds since early January to 18-year lows. March was crude's worst month since oil futures started trading on NYMEX in 1983.   ""In any business, if the sale price of a product falls 70% overnight, even companies with the best plans will struggle to overcome that,"" said Clark.   It's not just that prices have collapsed. At $20 a barrel they are now sharply below breakeven levels across every single major oil-producing region in the United States.   Even companies in the Permian Basin, the low-cost oilfield in West Texas that has led America's energy boom, require an average of $49 a barrel to profitably drill, according to a survey by the Dallas Federal Reserve.  At $40 a barrel, only 15% of oil companies would survive for a year or less, the Dallas Fed survey found. Another 24% of oil companies might be able to hold out for one to two years.   ""Many companies will be in trouble in this unprofitable environment,"" analysts at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.   Defaults on high-yield energy bonds could potentially spike to 30%, they added.  Denver-based Whiting might not be a household name, but it was valued at nearly $5 billion in late 2018.  Whiting focuses on drilling for oil in the Bakken, the high-cost North Dakota oilfield that thrived at $100 oil in the last decade but has struggled mightily since.   ""At sub-$60 oil prices, it became a slow bleed for Whiting. There was just no way they would survive with oil prices below $45 a barrel,"" said Cutter, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.   Whiting's bankruptcy filing lists between $1 billion and $10 billion of debt. The company said it has reached a deal with creditors to exchange $2.2 billion of debt for equity.   Money-losing oil companies can't refinance debt Oil companies aren't just bleeding cash. They have a mountain of debt coming due, and limited ability to refinance it.   More than perhaps any other industry, oil benefited from a decade of extremely low borrowing costs and insatiable demand for yield among investors. The junk bond market was wide open, even to the riskiest oil companies. Cheap financing helped make the United States the world's leading oil producer.  Even before this financial catastrophe investors were growing frustrated with the oil industry's weak financial performance. Over the last decade, the energy sector of the S&P 500 was the worst performer -- by far. Wall Street demanded oil companies live within their means by spending less and paying down debt.   And now that cash-strapped oil companies need to refinance their debt, the junk bond market is closed. No energy junk bonds were issued anywhere, to any company, in February and March, according to Dealogic.  Not surprisingly, investors have no interest in providing more capital to  money-losing firms. ""That is going to force a lot of these companies over the edge,"" said Cutter.    Red lights flashing The financial markets are signaling that more bankruptcies are coming.   The percentage of oil and gas companies with distressed credit ratios spiked from about 25% at the end of last year to 94% in mid-March, according to S&P Global Ratings.  Bond yields in the oil sector have also spiked well above ultra-safe Treasuries. That spread has more than tripled since the beginning of the year, to 11 percentage points, according to S&P. Spreads in the oil sector are nearly twice as high as the next-closest industry (metals and mining) and they have surpassed the highs of the 2008 financial crisis.   ""The entire sector is distressed,"" Cutter said.   A number of other large companies are likely to fail in the oil sector in coming months.  Analysts say the obvious candidates are companies whose bonds are flashing red lights, including Chesapeake Energy (CHK), California Resources (CRC), Denbury Resources (DNR), Ultra Petroleum (UPLC) and Oasis Petroleum (OAS).  Even oil companies that recently had investment-grade credit ratings could come under pressure, including Devon Energy (DVN), Hess (HES) and former Bakken darling Continental Resources (CLR).   Even Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the shale giant backed by legendary investor Warren Buffett, is grappling with heavy debt incurred by its ill-timed takeover last year of Anadarko Petroleum. Occidental's debt rating suffered a rare triple downgrade by Fitch Ratings last month.   Occidental has cut its dividend by 86%, slashed spending, instituted pay cuts and installed a new chairman.  Survival of the fittest The key to surviving this downturn will be how long oil prices stay below $40 a barrel.   A rapid rally, perhaps driven by a V-shaped economic recovery, would allow many struggling oil companies to get back on their feet.  But a sustained downturn in prices will be catastrophic for many oil companies. Unlike the 2014-2016 oil crash, some oil companies that file for Chapter 11 may not attract the financing needed to emerge from bankruptcy.   If that happens, the oil assets won't die. They would get scooped up at basement prices by whatever oil companies are left standing.   The silver lining, if there is one, is that the latest oil crash could bring about a much-needed cleansing in a terribly inefficient industry.   ""There have been too many weak companies hanging on for too long,"" said Jeff Wyll, senior energy analyst at Neuberger Berman.  It sounds oxymoronic, but a wave of bankruptcies could be just what's needed for America's oil industry to emerge stronger and more resilient.  ",4/2/2020

""This is a matter of public safety."" The decision was made after a fringe personality for the far-right media outlet, Chanel Rion, continued to attend the briefings, in defiance of the WHCA's new rules limiting the number of journalists in the room. The rule recently implemented by the WHCA restricts the number of journalists who can attend the briefings to increase the distance between reporters in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. Rion, who has produced what amounts to pro-Trump propaganda for OAN, attended both Tuesday and Wednesday's briefings, standing in the back of the room. Jon Karl, president of the White House Correspondents Association, told CNN earlier on Wednesday that its members have agreed they ""cannot be in the briefing room"" if they ""do not have a seat"" assigned on a particular day. ""So a reporter standing in the back who does not have a seat on that day is violating those rules and putting the health of the press corps in danger,"" Karl added. In its note to members, the WHCA board explained it took action Wednesday because Rion ""twice attended press briefings in contravention"" of its new policy. When Rion showed up to the briefing on Tuesday, she declined to leave and told a representative for the WHCA that she was a ""guest of Stephanie Grisham,"" the White House press secretary, a person familiar with the exchange told CNN. The WHCA is the organization responsible for assigning seats at the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, not the White House press secretary. Rion added that the representative for the WHCA could take up the matter with Grisham, the person familiar with the matter added. The Los Angeles Times was first to report the interaction between Rion and the WHCA. Grisham declined to comment on the record. Rion did not respond to a request for comment. Rion again showed up to the briefing on Wednesday, standing in the back and being called on by President Donald Trump. One America News is a cable channel with small viewership that is strongly supportive of Trump, who has repeatedly lauded the outlet for being friendly toward him. Rion is a far-right media personality with a history of peddling conspiracy theories. Rion has pushed the discredited idea that slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered by the Clinton family. In December, Rion traveled with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, to Ukraine and advanced conspiracy theories that aimed to give Trump cover for asking the country to investigate former Vice President and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden. Most recently, Rion promoted the conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was potentially created in a North Carolina laboratory.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/fitness-studios-coronavirus/index.html,The $94 billion fitness industry is reinventing itself as Covid-19 spreads,"The changes have rocked the fitness industry, which was worth $94 billion in 2018, according to The International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association.  Some studios -- such as Modo Yoga, which has locations in the United States, Canada, Australia and France -- are offering free classes on Instagram Live. Other studios, including SoulCycle, closed all of its locations globally, hoping to reopen when conditions improve and the curve flattens. The cult-favorite cycling studio doesn't have any online classes, but bikes are available for pre-order with a price tag of $2,500, and the company will release on-demand virtual classes later this year. And as gyms and boutique fitness studios continue to close, fitness instructors are getting creative and amping up their side hustles.  ""I've still been training clients that live in my building, though we've been using Lysol and in some cases latex gloves to be safe,"" Julie Verhage, a group fitness instructor at Equinox, said. Verhage also said that startups are reaching out to her and asking her to lead virtual workouts ""so they can still have team bonding while everyone is working remotely.""  Video classes ClassPass, a subscription service that partners with local boutique fitness classes, launched live workouts: More than 500 studios have added live, bookable classes to the platform, and 100% of livestream proceeds go directly to the studios. The company is also encouraging users to donate directly to their favorite studios through the ClassPass app, and the company is matching $1 million in donations.  A library of more than 2,000 pre-recorded audio and video workouts are also available for free -- without subscription -- on the ClassPass website.  ""The COVID-19 global pandemic has presented a challenge unlike any other that the health and wellness industry has seen,"" ClassPass CEO Fritz Lanman said in a statement. ""Almost 90% of our 30,000 gym, studio and wellness partners across 30 countries have indefinitely closed their physical locations.""  Jessica Goldman opened Dance Forever Studio in Chicago in 2005, but she recently closed her studio amid coronavirus concerns.  ""In the long term, the coronavirus will dilute the brick and mortar fitness industry model,"" Goldman told CNN Business in an email, adding that ""in an already crowded industry, the coronavirus will set the successful apart from the mediocre."" The disruption is pervasive Small studios are getting hit hard. In the hopes of reopening after closure, yoga studios like Sacred -- with locations in Brooklyn in Manhattan -- are charging $10 for virtual classes on Zoom. But some of the small studios probably won't recover, according to Nathan Forster, CEO of NEOU, an on-demand fitness video platform. ""I hope many of them can make it back, but there will definitely be some that don't,"" he told CNN Business in an email. Even big companies like Flywheel are trying to figure out how to navigate the financial hit to its business. On March 20, in a plea for money, the company sent an email to members, encouraging them to unfreeze their membership and continue paying a monthly fee even though the brick-and-mortar locations were closing. In March, the cycling company shut down the virtual classes that are connected to its in-home bikes, and Peloton is letting Flywheel customers swap out their bikes for a used Peloton bike for free. Many studios are creating YouTube video workouts in an effort to keep their clientele entertained and active. Cult-favorite HIIT studio Orange Theory, for instance, is sharing a free 30-minute workout on its website every day. It's not a smooth road for the studios that aren't accustomed to being primarily digital. Boston rowing studio The Row House offers a variety of free live-streamed classes on Facebook, but you can only participate in the classes if you have a rowing machine at home.  To bridge the gap, the company is offering members 60 days of free access to on-demand content for other fitness studios that share the same parent brand, Xponential Fitness, including Pilates, barre and yoga classes. Who benefits Meanwhile, virtual and digital fitness companies are benefiting from the industry shift. MIRROR, an interactive at-home fitness system that sells for $1,495 and looks like a full-length mirror, has seen an increase in sales.  ""Sales have more than doubled since the advent of Covid-19,"" MIRROR CEO Brynn Jinnett Putnam told CNN Business in an email. She added that MIRROR's team has been ""working around the clock to launch our digital product earlier than originally planned."" But it's not all uphill for primarily online fitness brands. MIRROR and Peloton both have brick-and-mortar studios. MIRROR closed its three showrooms -- one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, and one in Stanford California -- and Peloton closed its New York and London studios to the public, but the company will ""continue to produce live content without an audience,"" according to a statement from Peloton's co-founder and CEO John Foley. For online-only fitness services like Obé, business is booming. The service gives members unlimited access to 14 live classes a day and 4,000+ on-demand classes. It costs $27 per month or $199 per year.  Co-founders Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills said sales are soaring. ""We have seen a considerable increase in membership across the US in the last few weeks,"" he told CNN Business in an email. With an increasing number of parents and kids staying home, Obé released content for kids in partnership with KidzBop.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/n95-masks-counterfeits-supply-chain/index.html,N95 masks are in short supply -- and scammers know it,"Two leading N95 mask manufacturers have issued fraud warnings amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying they've received complaints about fraudsters trying to sell nonexistent product. And in one case, counterfeit masks have already made it to the front lines in the US.  Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, received a batch of 1,000 N95 masks a few weeks ago from a trusted longtime vendor, and determined they were fake. ""We have a policy of having our clinicians test a small sample of medical equipment like masks before we give it to our staff,"" said Jessica Griffin, the hospital's director of public relations. ""These masks did not fit the face area properly,"" nor were they marked with a specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approval label as N95 masks are required to have. It was a shock for Holy Name, which is currently treating 144 patients for Covid-19 and has tested 1,440 people in total. ""We're the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in New Jersey,"" Griffin said. Maintaining a consistent supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) like gowns and N95 masks for its doctors and nurses is crucial as the hospital continues to see a steady stream of patients. But across the world, N95 masks are in short supply, as they're considered the gold standard of respirator masks. They're able to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles from the air, including bacteria and viruses -- making them a crucial piece of equipment for doctors and nurses as they race to treat tens of thousands of coronavirus-infected patients in the United States.  That degree of protection is guaranteed, however, only with federally tested and certified masks that fit snugly around the nose and mouth -- creating a seal to minimize the number of particles that bypass the filter through gaps between the user's skin and the respirator, according to the CDC. Counterfeit respirators ""can compromise the safety of anyone who uses them, including healthcare providers,"" the CDC told CNN Business. Fortunately for the providers at Holy Name, the hospital's testing procedures caught the counterfeit N95 masks, and they returned the batch to the vendor -- who ultimately replaced them with 1,000 legitimate masks. Holy Name doesn't fault the vendor. But major N95 manufacturers and procurement companies are also sounding the alarm. Leading manufacturers flag scams 3M, the world's leading manufacturer of N95 masks, has received reports from healthcare customers of people selling counterfeit 3M products and falsely claiming associations with the company, the firm said in a letter last week to Attorney General William Barr. It warned about products with ""missing straps, strange odors, blocked valves, misspelled words, etc.,"" saying they are likely not authentic 3M respirators."" In the letter, 3M CEO Mike Roman also said the company is working with large online sellers and the authorities to identify and remove counterfeiters.  3M told CNN Business that while it hasn't seen a large influx of counterfeit respirators onto the market, it is tracking a bigger issue of fraudsters trying to collect money in exchange for masks they don't actually have. Prestige Ameritech, another top maker of N95 masks, has placed a ""Fraud Alert warning"" on its website saying its brand is also being used in ""mask selling scams."" The company said it, too, is working with authorities on the matter. Prestige Ameritech did not respond to calls for further comment. Suspect solicitations It's not only manufacturers but also product sourcing firms who are dealing with potential N95 mask scams.  Premier Inc. --  a North Carolina-based company that helps procure PPE for 4,000 hospitals and 175,000 non-acute providers like surgical centers -- recently received a strange call. A person posing as a ""broker"" offered Premier 500 million masks, saying they had access to the sizable inventory, said Chaun Powell, group vice president with Premier. The company promptly called 3M, who told Premier it would be impossible for anyone to have that many masks immediately available.  Meanwhile, scores of calls are pouring in. ""Last week we received 10 to 20 solicitations from agents for millions of N95 masks. This week it's 70 calls,"" Powell said. Even as 3M and other makers ramp up production, Powell said immediate shortages have created opportunity for ""questionable"" mask products to seep into the supply chain. ""We have already seen masks enter the supply chain that fail to meet basic testing parameters,"" he said. He said Premier was aware of counterfeit N95 masks that showed the 3M logo incorrectly positioned on the packaging, for example. ""We have no interest in creating fear and doubt in the market, but we are focused on protecting the integrity of the supplies that our nation's dedicated caregivers and patients depend on,"" said Powell. Supply chain experts say they aren't surprised about fake masks popping up -- and they expect the problem to accelerate. ""There's a high possibility of that because there's quite a lot of money to be made on these masks,"" said Rosemary Coates, executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit manufacturing research and consultancy group that advocates for bringing overseas jobs back to America. Coates has 30 years of expertise in supply chain management and counterfeit products. When a product becomes very popular in a short time period -- as the N95 mask has -- individuals emerge is who identify themselves as ""agents"" or ""brokers"" trying to score lucrative deals by selling counterfeits at a premium, Coates said. These middlemen might not even have any inventory initially, she added. ""They try to make a deal first with businesses that are trying to procure legitimate product, like the N95 mask. After they get a deal they then try to source the counterfeit version of the product."" ""Anytime there is money to be made by selling products at a premium,"" she said, ""counterfeiters will jump into the market.""",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/perspectives/tariffs-factories-farms-coronavirus/index.html,What Trump can do now to rescue America's factories and farms,"Although President Trump signed a ""phase one"" agreement with China in January, high tariffs remain on an original $350 billion in US imports. Getting rid of these tariffs will remove a painful yoke that had depressed American manufacturing and farming long before the coronavirus hit our shores. What's more, tariff rollbacks signal a desire to reduce mounting US-China trade tensions, offering a much-needed model of global cooperation at a time of shared crisis. Trump's trade war with China never made sense for America's factories. US tariffs on Chinese imports currently average about 20% and continue to cover two-thirds of US purchases. These taxes fall heaviest on parts and components used by US manufacturers. Firms facing Trump's tariffs are central to American manufacturing — they account for 84% of all exports and 65% of manufacturing employment. As these businesses experience unprecedented disruption from the coronavirus, they face significant financial and operational consequences, with no end in sight. A recent analysis of the 2018-19 tariff hikes suggests that import tax relief would be a meaningful way to assist American factories: Estimated tariffs paid by affected manufacturers were about $1,600 per worker per year. With tariff relief, these funds could be directed to assisting workers and meeting new health and hygiene needs. Suspending tariffs would put the onus on China to remove retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural exports, a move it would be likely to take. Throughout the trade war, China responded proportionally to each US action, meeting each tariff increase and rollback in kind. Given this pattern, China can be expected to cut its own tariffs in response to American actions to keep trade flowing during the crisis. Trump's trade war has put US farms at risk since its inception in 2018. Farm bankruptcies have risen, despite the distribution of emergency aid to farmers, and the administration has found it difficult to locate alternative markets for American grains and meats. As the economic impact of the coronavirus reduces consumption in major American agricultural markets around the globe, farmers are at heightened risk of further losses. The American Farm Bureau Federation states that ""COVID-19 impact on agriculture includes a rapid and unanticipated decline in commodity prices."" With the Chinese economy already beginning to recover from the virus, reopening their market to US exports will help to counteract these price declines and help American farmers avoid further unnecessary bankruptcies. President Trump can suspend his China tariffs immediately. He levied the tariffs through his executive powers, and he can simply suspend them as he suspended tariffs that had been teed up for implementation in December 2019. China already promised in the ""phase one"" agreement to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of US goods, and suspending tariffs would help ensure that they meet those targets. Moreover, the president can restore tariffs at any time, at any level, if they are deemed necessary. How America treats its trading partners now will resonate for years to come. Already, protectionism, not cooperation, is the order of the day. Global Trade Alert reports that, to date, 24 nations have placed limits on the export of medicine, medical equipment and supplies, a clear sign that international coordination is dangerously lacking at a time when we desperately need it. By dropping its harmful China tariffs, the United States can regain leadership of a system that is rudderless in a time of shared crisis. With Americans facing the unprecedented challenges of Covid-19 containment, and the deep recession that is expected to follow, it is time for President Trump to end a harmful policy that has outlived any usefulness. Suspending US tariffs on Chinese imports is a simple, immediate step that will quickly ease pain at home and demonstrate American leadership to a world sadly in need.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/coronavirus-labor-cross-industry-hiring-employee-sharing/index.html,How Covid-19 could redefine labor in America,"Almost overnight, entire industries were crippled, sidelining workers and putting millions of people on the unemployment rolls. Seeking to ease the pain and balance out volatility in the labor market, corporations now are forging unlikely alliances and striking cross-industry agreements to redeploy their furloughed workers.   The biggest names in hotels and retail are hoping to funnel their underemployed personnel to grocery chains, pharmacies, delivery services and others in desperate need of employees.  Albertsons created a ""hiring partner program"" with other large hospitality, restaurants and retail firms. Hilton created a job portal to 28 companies — among them Amazon (AMZN), Walgreens, Stop & Shop and The Home Depot — promising expedited hiring to its affected employees. On a smaller scale, Sedano's, a Miami-based Hispanic grocery chain, offered temporary employment to workers at two local restaurant chains.  The idea of workers transitioning from checking guests into hotel rooms to running grocery checkouts is intended to be a short-term fix for an acute and immediate problem. But labor and public policy experts say it could signal a long-term shift in how work is done in America. ""It could open up some eyes or a different way of thinking about employment,"" said Ravi Anupindi, professor of technology and operations and faculty director for the Center for Value Chain Innovation at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. The needs of now It didn't take long for pain points to emerge at the companies experiencing severe spikes in demand.  ""Our workers are pretty much at the max,"" said Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers in places such as grocery stores, meat-packing plants, chemical facilities and cannabis shops.  ""They're working six days a week, eight to 12 hours a day,"" he said. ""Ours are going to break at some point. It's a long time to be working that long of a shift on concrete all day. "" Perrone, who said favors employee-sharing arrangements, noted that UFCW opened a hiring portal of its own.  Working with companies like Albertsons and CVS in this capacity is completely new for such companies as Hilton and Kohl's. ""We are in an unprecedented situation with hotels nearing zero occupancy,"" Alison Menon, a Hilton spokesperson, wrote in an email to CNN Business. ""This is creating challenges for all 4.7 million people working in the US hospitality industry. Helping our team members find alternative work at this time is one of the best ways to support their financial health and ensure that Hilton is able to welcome the them back when travel resumes."" Kohl's, which announced store closures with plans to pay employees for up to 14 days, has partnered with Albertsons to find temporary work for affected employees, said Jen Johnson, the department store chain's senior vice president of communications.   ""We will welcome our associates back to Kohl's whenever we are able to reopen our stores,"" she said via email. ""We want our associates to do what's best for them and their families, which could mean seeking additional employment while our stores are temporarily closed."" Shifts in labor — especially at this scale — are usually time-intensive and costly, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a global outplacement firm. ""I love this idea of being able to seamlessly shift workers from an industry that has seen an enormous demand shock on the downside to an industry that has seen an enormous demand shock on the upside,"" he said.  If companies can agree on the back end of the arrangement, this shift could not only address their emergency needs but also protect the labor market whenever the nation emerges from this crisis, he said.  ""If this method facilitates a way to keep people marginally attached to a position until demand returns, it helps us recover and prevent so much pain for people in the long run,"" he said.  This addresses labor market frictions and eliminates elements that make it harder or more costly for employers to find workers, said economist Harry J. Holzer, a professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. Then again, it does give a leg up to an insider and could result in someone else — perhaps a person in a disadvantaged economic position — missing out on a job, he said, adding that another concern could be the potential for collusion on aspects such as wages and benefits.  ""One can imagine that if both sides of both firms like it, that they might want to continue some kind of arrangement like that,"" he said. ""And there again you can see the benefits to each side ... but I worry about that collusion issue."" What the future could bring Employee-sharing is hardly a new concept, but it's never been done to this scale, Anupindi said.  The practice has a longer history in Europe, he said, referencing studies by Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations School. In countries such as Belgium and France, companies establish an ""employer group"" and coordinate assignments to a shared group of workers who would have full-time employment but utilize their skills at several different companies. Although the concept remains a ""marginal labor market phenomenon,"" the Cornell studies found that they benefit workers and employers by providing stability, job security and growth in job skills. Alternatively, the efforts run the risk of overworking individuals as well as isolating them from an organizational structure.   Regardless, such moves require strong planning, mutual trust and a predictable pattern of employment needs.  ""For the employee-sharing at a large-scale level to work, there has to be a counter-cyclicality,"" Anupindi said. Without that he added,""this isn't going to happen.""  He uses as an example how a lawn mowing service whose workers are busy in summer could see value in sharing workforces with a business that specializes in snow removal in the wintertime.  But Covid-19 has been anything but predictable or expected. ""What you're seeing here is what I would classify as unpredictable seasonality — a shock to the system,"" he said.  Although it's doubtful that large companies will continue to run these services in a consistent manner, a look at China since the outbreak may offer some clues. Alibaba  (BABA)and JD.com launched employee-sharing programs in February. To what extent such arrangements continue could provide insights for other multinational companies.  ""This is, in my mind, the largest, global natural experiment"" of the future of work, Anupindi said.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/airline-industry-outlook/index.html,Airlines will offer fewer choices and higher fares after the coronavirus crisis,"Airline traffic has plunged and it probably won't recover any time soon. The $50 billion aviation bailout passed last week will keep airlines in business and employees on the job for the the next six months. Still, airline executives suggested they expect fewer flights and slumping demand for air travel for quite some time. ""If the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today,"" said United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby in a message to their employees last Friday. A leaner airline industry means some of the 750,000 jobs the industry had at the start of 2020 won't come back. Hundreds of planes will almost certainly stay grounded, which will mean less capacity and higher fares. Many of the low-cost seats that passengers have enjoyed booking will disappear.  Fliers will have less choice -- of airlines, of flight times, and of available routes and markets. All of that means passengers will pay more when they return to the air. ""Fewer seats flying means fewer cheap seats at the margin,"" Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for airlines for S&P Global. A long time to recover lost traffic This isn't the first time the airline industry has needed to contract in response to a sudden shock. Before the terrorist attack of 9/11 happened, there were nine major US airlines. Today most of those nine airlines -- iconic carriers such as Continental, Northwest, and US Airways - have been merged into four remaining major carriers -- American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL) and Southwest (LUV). Those four majors controlled 80% of the miles flown by passengers on US airlines last year. The rest of the market is taken up by smaller carriers offering cheaper fares, such as Spirit (SAVE), JetBlue (JBLU) and Allegiant (ALGT). The presence of those carriers helps keep some of the seats on the major carriers available at lower prices. But almost no one is flying today. The number of passengers entering TSA screening points fell 93% between Tuesday and the last Tuesday of March in 2019. It will take a long time for passenger traffic to recover, even after the coronavirus is under control and people can fly again. Traffic finally bounced back in 2004, following the 2001 terrorist attacks.  And after the Great Recession of 2008, it wasn't until 2013 that passenger traffic reached what it was in 2007, the final year before the Great Recession. Those drops in traffic were a mere fraction of the decline that occurred over the last four weeks. Less choices for passengers This coronavirus crisis is so much more severe than past downturns in the industry that there's a good chance there could be a new round of mergers and airline failures that the industry has gone through in the past. ""In the near term, we're going to see a shakeout,"" said Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ""The weaker players may not survive this. Most industry leaders are expecting a long, painful recovery."" Even if all the current US airlines manage to survive, airlines big and small will pull back from markets and routes that have become unprofitable in the new environment. Even on routes they maintain, they'll reduce the frequency of flights to fill up a greater percentage of seats.  That will lead to higher fares than before the crisis.  ""There's going to be fewer airplanes. That means less flying,"" said industry consultant Mike Boyd. ""So there's going to be less choice, and you'll be paying more. There's no way around that.""  A new round of mergers? In the past, economic problems in the industry have led to bankruptcy and mergers. Many of the deals since 9/11 have taken place as part of a bankruptcy process.  From April through June of last year, US airlines' revenue totaled $64.4 billion, according to Transportation Department data. But the industry is getting only a small percentage of that revenue stream right now. Even with a $50 billion federal bailout, the government is only providing a fraction of the revenue lost in the current drop in air traffic.  So it's possible that two of the big carriers could once again merge, further consolidating control of the market.  What might work against a merger of the major carriers could be the nature of this crisis, said Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for airlines for S&P Global. He said previous bankruptcies and mergers helped airlines shed debt or get out of labor contracts they couldn't afford. This crisis is different. ""More than too much debt or their costs being too high, it's just the loss of revenue,"" he said. ""Unfortunately mergers or even bankruptcies can't address that.""  But a merger among majors is still possible as airlines seek to fill seats and further trim administrative overhead.  While such deals would need the approval of antitrust regulators, the Justice Department has rarely blocked airline mergers in the past, particularly at a time of financial crisis for one or both parties. And they could be approved despite antitrust concerns, said Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ""There are all kinds of industries where there are only three or even two major players,"" he said. ""You could envision a deal among majors clearing antitrust hurdles, especially if the industry is on the ropes."" Also possible: the upstart, low-fare carriers could fail and be swallowed up by the bigger carriers. At the very least, they may have to drop out of their less profitable markets. But it's virtually certain that passengers will have fewer choices even if none of the airlines merge or go out out business, as airlines respond to the new, lower traffic environment with smaller operations for the foreseeable future.

The economic fallout from business closings and job losses is expected to have a greater impact on black and Latino employees, who make up a disproportionate percentage of occupational sectors experiencing the income disruption amid the pandemic. ""When white America catches a cold, black America catches pneumonia,"" Steven Brown, a research associate at the Urban Institute domestic policy research organization, told CNN Business. Government data shows the outbreak is more concentrated in major US metropolitan areas like New York City, New Orleans and the nation's southeast where greater percentages of black and Latino Americans live. In New York City, the virus is disproportionately affecting lower-income neighborhoods in Queens, Harlem and the Bronx, which have denser populations of immigrants of color, African Americans and Hispanics. Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans also tend to have more underlying health conditions, like asthma, than whites, which USA Today says makes them more likely to suffer from serious health effects from the coronavirus. Those health effects could mean more hospital visits and more medical debt at a time when many are losing their jobs and health benefits. Chuck Collins, director of the Institute for Policy Studies' ""Inequality and the Common Good"" program, says America's already enormous racial wealth disparity is likely to grow ""unless we pursue a very different set of interventions and stimulus,"" than those put in place in response to the Great Recession of 2008. The average black household had a net worth of $140,000 in 2016, while the average white household's net worth that same year was $901,000, according to a Survey of Consumer Finances study cited by the Federal Reserve. Most of that white wealth was concentrated among the top 1% of American earners. Economists from the Corporation for Enterprise Development and Institute for Policy Studies predicted that black families wouldn't earn the same wealth held by white families in 2016 until the year 2241, when white families would have even greater wealth. Latinos would match the earnings of whites in 2016 by 2097, researchers concluded. Collins said the $2 trillion authorized by Congress is a good start to getting Americans back on their feet, but much more needs to be done. ""Nobody's going to talk about [how we're] paying for this anytime soon. When and if they do, there's going to be a huge fight over who's going to carry the load here,"" he said. ""If we did income support right so people didn't have to go to work ... then people aren't going into debt. That could help close the racial wealth divide."" Brown agrees that the current crisis is likely to widen America's racial wealth disparity. The 2008 financial crisis actually hurt white Americans more economically than blacks and Latinos, contrary to popular belief, and ironically narrowed the racial wealth gap, at least temporarily. It's true that the unemployment rate for black Americans peaked at 16.8% in 2010, more than twice that of white Americans. But Brown points out that white Americans owned a disproportionate number of the homes foreclosed on by banks and a greater share of the retirement investments that were decimated when the stock market crashed nearly 12 years ago. ""Black families also lost wealth, but they had less to lose,"" Brown told CNN Business. Collins agrees that white families lost more in the stock market in 2008, but says they were able to recover much of those losses in the following two years. ""White wealth rebounded very quickly,"" he said. ""It was more diversified and wasn't just in real estate."" The Great Recession did significant damage to Americans families' assets, but Brown said so far the coronavirus is having a greater affect on Americans' ability to pay their day-to-day bills. ""The thing to keep an eye on is debt,"" Brown said. ""Black and brown families are more likely to have no savings or net worth at all. ... If they lost their job, going check-to-check even two weeks can mean some credit card bills or utilities don't get paid. ""It's going to be a lot harder for people to dig out once things get stable again,"" he added.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/business/oil-prices-trump-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html,Oil prices spike by a record 25% as Trump talks up huge production cuts and Saudi Arabia calls for OPEC meeting ,"President Donald Trump suggested massive production cuts could be on the way and Saudi Arabia called for an ""urgent"" meeting between OPEC, Russia and other unnamed nations to restore ""balance"" to the oil market.  Even though no date has been set for such a meeting — and no deal on cutting production has yet been announced — the oil market celebrated wildly.  US oil prices soared as much as 35% to $27.39 a barrel after Trump said on Twitter that he hopes and expects Saudi Arabia and Russia will slash output by between 10 million and 15 million barrels per day. Crude closed with a surge of 25% to $25.32 a barrel. That exceeds the previous one-day record that was set exactly two weeks ago. Trump's tweet followed a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""If it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!"" the US president tweeted.  Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in an epic price war since early March, flooding the oil market with cheap crude just as demand is cratering because of the coronavirus pandemic. Crude has crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks.  'Burden sharing' Although Trump suggested the deep cuts would be coming solely from Saudi Arabia and Russia, there are signs that OPEC is looking for other countries, including perhaps the United States, to join in. ""We need to see burden sharing,"" a source within the OPEC+ alliance told CNN Business' John Defterios. ""Not fair for two or three producers within OPEC+ to carry most of the responsibility.  Previous cuts by OPEC and its allies have given US shale producers room to capture market share. The United States recently surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer.  ""The Saudis are absolutely crystal clear that they are not doing this alone. It's not just a Saudi-Russia cut,"" said Helima Croft, RBC Capital's global head of commodity strategy. ""They're done with the situation where they cut and the US grows."" Some US oil producers have urged officials in Texas to impose caps on the state's oil production -- a step that would run counter to the industry's free-market ethos. The Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state's energy industry, hasn't exercised that power in more than 40 years. Ryan Sitton, a commissioner on that regulatory body, said Thursday he had a ""great conversation"" with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in which they discussed the need to remove 10 million barrels per day from global oil supply. ""While we normally compete,"" Sitton said in a tweet, ""we agreed that #COVID19 requires unprecedented levels of int'l cooperation."" He added that he will speak to Saudi Arabia's energy minister soon.  Trump also tweeted that bin Salman had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the Kremlin denied such a phone call had taken place, news that took some of the heat out of the huge spike in oil prices.  A truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia would aid an oil market that analysts estimate is oversupplied by around 25 million barrels per day. Demand for transport fuels in particular has been decimated by travel restrictions aimed at containing the pandemic.  'Completely unrealistic' The official Saudi Press Agency said in a tweet Thursday that the kingdom is seeking a meeting for members of the OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, ""and another group of countries"" in an attempt to try to reach a ""fair solution to restore the desired balance of the oil markets."" It's not clear who would be part of that additional group of countries.  The tweet said the invitation is part of Saudi Arabia's efforts to support the global economy ""and in appreciation of the US President's request and the US friends' request."" Analysts expressed skepticism that Saudi Arabia and Russia would suddenly reverse course and slash production by nearly as much as Trump suggested. ""This is a completely unrealistic expectation,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Smith pointed out that even the low end of Trump's touted production cuts, 10 million barrels, amounts to virtually all of Saudi Arabia's output.  ""From a logic standpoint, from a political standpoint, it doesn't make any sense,"" he said. Big cuts by Russia would undermine its goal of drowning high-cost US shale producers in a sea of cheap oil. The recent crash in oil prices to $20 a barrel will likely set off a wave of bankruptcies and job cuts in the US oil industry, including in many Republican-leaning states.   Demand, not supply, is the No. 1 problem Production cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia would ease a great deal of pressure in the oil market. However, the primary cause of the oil crash is weak demand, not excess supply. The extreme restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic have caused an unprecedented collapse in oil demand. Highways are empty. Passenger jets have been parked. And factories are not operating.  US gasoline demand, the No. 1 swing factor for global oil demand, is plunging because most Americans have been forced to work from home.  IHS Markit estimates that US gasoline demand could collapse by more than 50% during the coronavirus response period. That would easily surpass the demand lost during the Great Recession. All of this means that even if there is a truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia, prices may remain under pressure. — John Defterios contributed to this article.",4/2/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/business/oil-prices-trump-opec/index.html,"Trump's incredible 180 on OPEC, oil and free markets ","In the past, Trump has called OPEC a ""monopoly"" (it's not) that must be broken up. ""They are robbing our country blind,"" he tweeted in November 2012. Since winning the presidency, Trump has repeatedly hammered OPEC for engineering higher oil prices to hurt American drivers.  ""OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike -- fragile!"" the president tweeted in February 2019.  Flash forward to 2020: Instead of slamming OPEC for artificially restraining production, Trump is urging the cartel to do just that.   And rather than calling for OPEC to be broken up, Trump is elevating the group's status by encouraging it to stop the oil crash -- one that threatens to set off a surge of bankruptcies and job losses in Texas and throughout America's oil industry.  Trump is even attempting to broker an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to end their devastating price war by massively cutting production. The president's tweets on the subject Thursday helped US oil prices to spike 25% -- their biggest one-day gain in history.  ""It's amazing to have Trump get in the middle of this,"" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNN Business.  ""Think about the 180: For years, Trump hated collusion among the producers and wanted to get rid of OPEC.""  Texas is a huge prize in 2020 That reversal reflects shifting political realities. The coronavirus pandemic is causing millions of job losses ahead of the November presidential election. A prolonged downturn in the US oil industry would only amplify the economic pain, especially in Republican-leaning states. ""What has changed is the political equation: Donald Trump cannot win reelection without Texas. It's as simple as that,"" said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments.   Not only is Texas the second-biggest electoral prize (after California), it's also by far the nation's largest oil producer. In fact, Texas pumps more oil than every OPEC nation not named Saudi Arabia.   But Texas is getting crushed by cheap oil. Russia, seeking to blunt the rise of US shale oil producers, refused last month to cut oil production. Saudi Arabia responded by surging output and slashing prices.  Reflecting the urgency of the moment, Trump is meeting with the CEOs of ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and other leading US oil companies Friday to discuss the crisis facing the industry.  Navigating this situation is a delicate balance. The White House doesn't want oil bankruptcies and job losses on its hands. But Trump doesn't want to be seen helping oil CEOs and Saudi Arabia at the expense of average Americans who want cheap gas prices.   'I would always raise hell with OPEC' The president has acknowledged his evolving views.  ""You always get a little torn,"" Trump said on March 20. ""Until we became the leading producer, I was always for the person driving the car and filling up the tank of gas...If (prices were too high, I would always raise hell with OPEC.""  Now the oil crash is setting off real turmoil in the energy industry. Whiting Petroleum (WLL), a former rising star in the shale industry, this week became the first of what will surely be a wave of US oil companies to file for bankruptcy during this crisis.   Nearly 100 US oil and gas producers could file for Chapter 11 over the next year, Buddy Clark, co-chair of the energy practice at Houston law firm Haynes and Boone, told CNN Business.  And that may be the optimistic view. Rystad Energy warned this week that 140 US oil producers could file for bankruptcy this year if oil stays at $20 a barrel, followed by another 400 in 2021.   Even the largest oil companies are cutting back. Debt-ridden Occidental Petroleum (OXY) slashed its dividend by 86% and announced pay cuts across the entire company. Chevron (CVX) is cutting production and spending in hopes of avoiding its first dividend cut since the Great Depression.   ""We have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged,"" Trump said Wednesday during a press briefing. ""We don't want to lose our great oil companies.""  Will Texas cap output? Now there is a debate playing out over whether and even how the United States should intervene in the oil war.  Some independent oil producers are pushing Texas to -- for the first time in more than 40 years -- limit the state's output.   Ryan Sitton, a commissioner on the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state's energy regulator, even held a call Thursday with Russia's energy minister to discuss options.  ""While we normally compete,"" Sitton said in a tweet, ""we agreed that #COVID19 requires unprecedented levels of int'l cooperation."" He added that he will speak to Saudi Arabia's energy minister soon.  Shale pioneer Harold Hamm and others are pushing for Trump, the self-proclaimed ""Tariff Man,"" to sanction OPEC by enacting tariffs that would punish Russia and Saudi Arabia for their ruinous oil war. But the American Petroleum Institute, the nation's largest oil lobby, is urging Trump to avoid intervening in free markets.  Trump has so far taken modest steps, including instructing the Energy Department to take advantage of cheap prices by filling up the nation's emergency stockpile of crude.   Debate over free markets OPEC has signaled it isn't willing to keep cutting production -- unless other countries join in and do so, too. The cartel will meet via video conference Monday with Russia and other countries outside the alliance, two sources at the OPEC secretariat told CNN Business. Although the final list of invitees has not yet been set, the United States, Canada and Mexico could reportedly be invited.   But it's not clear how the United States would enact its own production cuts. US output is controlled by thousands of different companies across the nation who all have their own competing interests.  The irony calling on OPEC to come to the rescue is that Trump and others for years have complained that OPEC distorts free markets.   And Now that Saudi Arabia and Russia have stopped artificially restraining their production, they're being urged to step back in to calm markets.  ""This is the free market. We are living in the world of NOPEC right now,"" RBC's Croft said. ""OPEC's cuts gave US producers a vital lifeline. Now that the lifeline has been withdrawn, you have figures in Washington wanting sanctions against OPEC.""",4/3/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/perspectives/us-economy-predictions-coronavirus/index.html,Economists: Be skeptical of any claim the US economy will recover quickly,"In just the last two weeks of March alone, nearly 10 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance. So in that time, about 6% of the US labor force lost their job. And consumers — the lifeblood of the economy — recently saw their confidence plunge to a 32-month low. Large parts of the economy have suddenly shut off, and turning them back on will not be a simple reversal of the switch. Given the substantial uncertainty about the depth and duration of this downturn and the path to recovery, The Conference Board has mapped out three scenarios for the US economy. They range from a reboot in the coming months to a deep, long-lasting contraction.  We believe America should prepare for a long road to recovery. The likeliest scenario — specifically, for a situation where unemployment mushrooms to 15%, a record in modern American history — is the economy starts growing again by no earlier than September, and US GDP for the year contracts by 6%. For context, in 2019 — when the economy was humming — GDP grew by 2.3%. If American businesses prepare for this long, grueling haul, they can emerge from the crisis stronger. Expecting a rapid recovery that doesn't pan out would only cause more pain. 1. In this scenario, we assume the pandemic will at least partially be controlled by social distancing efforts, which will flatten the curve of new cases throughout the next two to three months. While this would reduce the virus's burden on the health care sector, it also means the economic damage would hurt a broader swath of sectors than in the other scenarios. Industries most sensitive to social distancing — especially the entertainment, hospitality, restaurant and airline industries — could shrink by 65% by the end of the second quarter. Wholesale, retail trade and manufacturing could decline by 20% to 25% over the course of three months. And even finance and business services could see a fall or strong slowdown in output. While growth may eventually return during the fall and create a positive fourth quarter, we estimate that unemployment would remain high and could still be 15% by year's end. The economy would shrink by 6% in 2020, which would mark the largest decline since 1946, when the economy dropped by almost 12% due to the demobilization from World War II and the sharp pullback in military production. Even then, our economy eventually transitioned back to a period of peace and prosperity. We, too, can come out of this stronger. 2. Our second scenario assumes a higher number of people will be infected by the virus, and the peak may not be reached until May. This situation could emerge if the precautionary measures to stem the rise in new cases are relaxed too soon before the curve really starts to flatten. Prematurely loosening the policies could backfire, resulting in many Americans having to enter full lock-down mode to avoid an escalation of new cases. Even if such restrictions eased during the summer, many people wouldn't be able to resume their pre-crisis daily routines until June or even July.  In this situation, the severity of the economic contraction intensifies during the second quarter. And along with the sectors most sensitive to social distancing, it also hurts retail, wholesale trade and manufacturing much more than in the first scenario. While we could see a strong rebound — in other words, a V-shaped recovery — during the third quarter, the damage already done will cause GDP to fall sharply by 5.5% for the year. Unemployment could balloon to 15% or even more, although it might begin dropping off later in the year.  This V-shaped scenario comes with a big caveat: It has by far the most uncertain outcome. After all, if the outbreak runs out of control, the outcome could be much worse than we predict. Another risk of this scenario is that the chances of a resurgence of coronavirus cases during the fall increases, adding to the uncertainty. It's the nightmare scenario for business planners. 3. Of course, we still hope for a more optimistic scenario that assumes new virus cases peak by mid-April across most of the United States, making a quicker reboot of the economy possible. But time is running out, and epidemiological data suggest it's increasingly unlikely. And in the remote case that this scenario pans out, unemployment would probably peak at 10% by the end of the second quarter. Given recent data, we believe that the US unemployment rate is already at 10%. We should resist the urge to go back to normal too quickly. If we persevere and plan for the future, we'll come out better. ",4/3/2020

The Anheuser-Busch Inbev-owned company also makes Modelo and Pacifico beers. This week, the Mexican government announced the suspension of non-essential activities in the public and private sectors until April 30 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The country has more than 1,500 cases and 50 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins.  Grupo Modelo is ready to enact a plan to ""guarantee the supply of beer"" if the Mexican government decides to include breweries as essential, according to a statement. Constellation Brands (STZ) handles the distribution and import of Grupo Modelo's beers in the United States. CEO Bill Newlands said in an earnings call the brand has ""ample supply to meet consumer demand"" and doesn't expect shortages in the near term.

Constellation said sales of its beer brands grew 8.9% for the first three months of this year, with Modelo and Corona being its top sellers. Sales accelerated in the first three weeks of March, the company said, with its beers growing 24% compared to a year ago.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,Oil for less than $10 a barrel is on the horizon. Will OPEC blink first?,"But the cartel undercut that argument last month by adding to the considerable market mayhem. OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and oil ally Russia duked it out in a price war that eventually helped send crude crashing to 18-year lows. Now OPEC has an opportunity to restore calm to oil markets experiencing historic levels of volatility. But it won't be easy. What's happening: OPEC+ plans to hold a meeting via video conference Thursday where the group could finally make the production cuts that were badly needed weeks ago to make up for the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  President Donald Trump dramatically raised expectations for significant output cuts. Trump said last Thursday he hopes and expects Saudi Arabia and Russia will slash production by 10 million to 15 million barrels per day. Even though no deal has been announced -- and analysts immediately cast doubt on Trump's claim -- oil prices spiked Wednesday by the most on record. For the week, US crude surged 32% -- the best week since oil futures began trading on NYMEX in 1983.  ""Given that the oil market is now expecting a large reduction in output, anything less could send prices into freefall,"" Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. Oil producers are racing against time. The supply glut is so massive that the world will soon run out of space to store all those barrels. And that could send prices crashing into single-digits, exacerbating what will likely be a wave of bankruptcies in the US oil industry. But no one wants to be the first to blink in this battle. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, tired of being the one taking the brunt of production cuts, wants other countries to join in. And there are reports that the United States, Canada and Mexico could be invited to this week's meeting. Output will naturally drop in the United States as high-cost drillers respond to the crash. And regulators in Texas are being urged to consider production limits -- something that hasn't happened in more than 40 years. But it's unclear how such oil output could be limited at the national level. Russia may finally agree to production cuts, with Vladimir Putin reportedly proposing Friday that global production get cut by 10 million barrels per day.  However, in exchange Moscow may insist on sanctions relief from Washington.  ""There is a price for getting Russia back to the table. And it's unclear Washington is willing to pay that price,"" said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. In the end, even if all the pieces fall into place and a grand bargain is reached, it's possible it will be too little, too late. Demand is collapsing at an unprecedented rate and there's little Putin, MBS and Trump can do about that.

""We were looking at losing £150,000 ($180,000) a month if we didn't do anything,"" James Hill, the managing director of Hampton Manor told CNN Business. ""We had to contract our team to a core for us to be able to survive."" James Hill has been running Hampton Manor for 11 years with his wife, Fjona Hill, who described the start of 2020 as an ""emotional roller coaster."" Earlier in March, pressure on the business was mounting, putting dozens of jobs in jeopardy. But then, Aldi offered to take on dozens of Hampton Manor staffers.  The German company's head office in the United Kingdom is near Hampton Manor, and it sometimes uses the venue for events and conferences. Faced with panic buying of food and supplies, the discount grocer was in need of workers. So Aldi temporarily hired 30 Hampton Manor employees. The UK government has since pledged to pay 80% of employee wages during the crisis, but at the time Aldi's intervention was a ""miracle"" for Hampton Manor. ""That was a huge moment of relief for us,"" said James Hill.  But faced with a loss of diners at Peel's, which boasts a Michelin star, and revenue from weddings, the entire estate temporarily closed its doors. ""We've closed everything. We were basically unviable because we relied a lot on weddings to keep our revenue up ... without the wedding business we will be in massive losses,"" Fjona Hill told CNN Business.   A coronavirus reinvention  The Hills, who describe themselves as ""foodie diehards,"" quickly sought to reinvent their operation. The goal was to give back to their community as it adapted to social distancing rules. ""We wanted to come up with a model that both met the need of the community and kept some of our team working as well,"" said James Hill. One program the team came up with has been dubbed ""Peel's on Wheels,"" under which meals are prepared by chefs and delivered to customers. For every meal purchased, the Hills supply another to a vulnerable individual or elderly person in isolation.  ""It's advertised as one-for-one model but in reality we'll probably give out more meals than we are selling,"" said James Hill. ""The goal is to encourage people to support their community by buying from us,"" he added.  Urban Devotion, which works with vulnerable young people and families around Birmingham, is benefiting from the initiative. Andy Winmill, who leads the charity and helps coordinate the distribution of food parcels to other groups in the region, acknowledged it was early days but said he was excited by the partnership.  ""We have been working closely with one local primary school, so we using their kitchen to cook up the stuff provided by Hampton Manor,"" Winmill said. ""Some businesses are just having to shut down, but it's exciting to see business getting creative in how they can survive.""  A second initiative Hampton Manor plans to introduce is called ""drive thru."" Customers in cars will be able to pick up hampers, which will be full of homemade ingredients and vegetables, sourced from the estate. The goal is to provide quality meals while adhering to social distancing requirements.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/08/success/ugly-houses/index.html,How to sell your 'ugly' house when no one is biting,"But what if you can't or won't fix up your house? A property that is dated, unrenovated or unloved, can linger on the market for months, pushing the price down. Fixer-uppers may have been appealing a decade ago, but today they leave buyers cold, said McKenzie Ryan, an agent with Compass in New York City.  ""Ten years ago, most people wanted to add some value and put their own fingerprint on it,"" she said. ""Now it has been such a shift, particularly with millennial buyers -- they want a finished product. They don't want to put in the sweat equity.""  For homeowners without the money or time for a renovation, new options can help sell a property with no out-of-pocket costs.  Pre-sale renovations with no upfront cost Some real estate agencies, like Compass, Coldwell Banker and Keller Williams, are offering renovation services with no upfront costs to their clients. The firms then recoup the cost of the renovation from the price of the home after it sells.  Ryan was hired to sell a two-bedroom, two-bath condo on Manhattan's Upper West Side after the owners were unable to sell it with another agent at a list price of $1.3 million. The feedback the sellers received was that prospective buyers would be more interested in the home if it were updated.  So, together with the owners, Ryan is fixing it up. Her company's service, Compass Concierge, fronts the cost of the home improvements. The condo will be painted, the floors will be sanded and stained, kitchen cabinets will be painted and receive new hardware, and a bathroom will get a new vanity, flooring and a light fixture. Once all the renovations are complete, the condo will go back on the market for $1.395 million -- a price that will more than make up for the cost of renovations. ""When I've done this with properties, my listings have sold quicker and at a higher price compared to similar properties in the building,"" Ryan said. Sell quickly with no showings Many investors -- called instant buyers or ibuyers -- advertise quick cash offers for ""ugly houses,"" often at below-market prices. They flip the properties for a profit, saving sellers the hassle of showings and costly renovations. Even real estate firms, like Zillow and Redfin, have ibuyer divisions that will make a cash offer on a home -- often sight unseen -- based on the specific location and attributes of the property. Sundae, a real estate company based in southern California, buys homes with a quick cash offer, and then renovates and flips them. After a representative does an in-person evaluation of a home that is then analyzed by a construction cost expert and a valuation expert, Sundae makes the seller a cash offer.  Homeowners can sell as-is, with no fees, repairs, cleanups or showings and also get up to a $10,000 cash advance from the sale upfront to help with the move, if needed. Some closings have happened in as little as 10 days. ""When people come to us we evaluate three things: Do you have the money for renovations? Do you have the time? Do you have the know-how?"" said Josh Stech, CEO at Sundae. ""If the home needs a little bit too much work, selling to Sundae may be a good option.""  And Stech said, people sometimes need a hand to hold, since a quick sale is often brought on by an unplanned life event. ""Often people are in duress,"" Stech said. ""They are going through a transaction that is unfamiliar and high stakes and typically there is a relocation, divorce or death involved.""   Selling the home with no showings -- especially for people with serious pet issues, a history of hoarding or estate sales in which family members may not be nearby -- can be the most appealing part for some sellers.  For many people, he said, it matters what happens to the house even as they walk away.  ""They want a family to live there,"" said Stech. ""They want to see that the house has the kids and dog running around the backyard like they remember from 30 years ago. They just can't do the work to get it there.""",4/5/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/tech/instacart-hiring/index.html,"Instacart plans to hire 300,000 more workers as demand surges for grocery deliveries","The on-demand grocery startup said Monday that it seeks to hire 300,000 ""full-service shoppers,"" who are treated as independent contractors, in North America over the next three months due to increased demand spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. That would more than double its current workforce of full-service shoppers. ""The last few weeks have been the busiest in Instacart's history and our teams are working around the clock to reliably and safely serve all members of our community,"" said Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta in a statement.  Instacart is one of several companies delivering essentials to households that are now expanding fast at a time when much of the American economy is at risk of contracting. Amazon and Walmart each recently announced they plan to hire at least 100,000 workers due to increased customer demand. Yet, there are concerns about whether companies are doing enough for workers, who are the backbone of the services they offer, during this unprecedented public health crisis.  While Instacart has touted its surge in customer orders in recent weeks and introduced an option for customers to have orders left at their doorsteps, workers have criticized the company for not doing enough for them. Like other gig economy companies, Instacart said it will provide paid sick leave to workers diagnosed with coronavirus or placed under quarantine by public health authorities. But coronavirus tests remain hard to come by in the United States and many workers can't afford to stop working without paid time off. As with Amazon warehouse workers, some Instacart workers fear contracting the virus on the job. Additionally, some Instacart workers have said they received low ratings from customers for things outside their control -- like being unable to get items that were out of stock -- which impacted the future orders they received. They've also lost tips as a result.  After CNN Business noted the issue in a story last week, the company announced that ratings would not impact access to future orders for workers during the pandemic. (An Instacart spokesperson previously told CNN Business that tips are always left up to the customer's discretion.) In a letter last week, Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts called on the government to protect gig workers in its next relief package, asking it to ensure paid leave protections for gig workers whose jobs cannot be done from home. For example, California, the first state to declare a shelter-in-place order last week, indicated that on-demand food and meal delivery companies, as well as rideshare companies, are essential businesses and will continue to operate. In early March, Seattle-based workers' rights organization Working Washington called on food and meal delivery companies, as well as the government, to better protect workers. One of the demands: requiring customers to flag whether they're isolated because of a coronavirus diagnosis so workers can avoid those jobs or take additional protective measures.  In addition to its contract workforce, Instacart also has about 12,000 in-store shoppers who are considered part-time employees. Instacart, which operates in 5,500 cities in North America, said the need for more workers is where it is seeing the most customer demand, including California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, and Ohio. The coronavirus demand for Instacart's services is a remarkable turnaround for a startup once thought to have an uncertain future after Amazon acquired Whole Foods, a grocery chain Instacart partnered with. Instacart was valued at nearly $8 billion in late 2018 after a round of financing. CEO Mehta has previously said that an IPO is ""on the horizon.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/tech/vr-live-music-intl/index.html,How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"In the last few years, musicians have been able to stream concerts to virtual reality headsets, allowing fans to enjoy the virtual spectacle from the comfort of their homes. Now some VR platforms are going beyond just recreating the live experience, by offering viewpoints and interactions that users could never get if they were at the venue.  Launched in 2018, MelodyVR has built a library of live shows, recorded for streaming to Oculus VR headsets or iPhone and Android devices through its app at a later date. It says it has worked with more than 850 musicians, including Kelly Clarkson, Wiz Khalifa and Lewis Capaldi. As well as being able to watch from a position in the audience, users can view the concerts as if they were backstage, behind the sound booth, or even on stage with the band. The company has also created more novel experiences; a VR performance by British singer Emeli Sandé displays two images of her simultaneously, one playing the piano and the other singing.  This year, MelodyVR plans to begin offering live streaming via a paid-for virtual ticket, and has designed its own cameras for the task. ""We needed to create [VR cameras] that wouldn't get in the way of the production, but can also survive the variety of elements that could come with a musical performance, whether that is artists jumping around right next to the camera, champagne [being sprayed on them], or fireworks right in front of them,"" Steven Hancock, co-founder of MelodyVR, told CNN Business.  The company, owned by EVR Holdings, says it holds global VR distribution licenses with major labels Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group, as well as Beggars Group.  MelodyVR wouldn't disclose how many users it has, or how many people have watched shows through the platform, but EVR Holdings was valued at around £220 million ($285 million) as recently as January.  It currently operates a pay-per-view model — from $1.99 for one song to around $10 for a whole concert — on Oculus headsets and via its mobile app. This year it will offer a monthly subscription that gives unlimited access to concerts and exclusive sessions. It wouldn't disclose the cost of the subscription. MelodyVR isn't the only company to deliver VR music performances. Facebook's (FB) Oculus Venues offers live VR experiences of sporting events and comedy shows, and last year, it live streamed a Billie Eilish concert in Madrid. As well as sporting events, NextVR offers ""immersive music experiences"" filmed in nightclubs and studios. Last year, DJ Marshmello reportedly drew millions of attendees to his virtual show in the online game Fortnite. The future for VR One challenge for companies streaming concerts is that the market for dedicated VR headsets remains relatively small. Tech market researcher ABI Research predicts the VR market will surpass $24.5 billion in revenues by 2024, while acknowledging that ""VR has yet to live up to its early expectations."" For comparison, the global games market was worth around $149 billion in 2019, according to market intelligence firm Newzoo. But some analysts see a brighter future. Scott Buchholz, Deloitte's emerging tech research director, told CNN Business that ""[The VR market] is likely to continue to grow, particularly as we see an increasing convergence of AR and VR gear, as well as prices continuing to drop and capabilities continuing to rise,""  MelodyVR says it will release its own VR headset this year, for use with its phone app. Priced at around $20, as with other smartphone headsets on the market, the user's phone will act as the screen and speaker.  Hancock dismissed suggestions that live VR concerts could mean fans will no longer travel to actual performances. ""If (someone can) go to a show (they) always will,"" he said. ""But for all of the limiting factors as to why people can't get to live shows, be it geographical restrictions, age restrictions, or cost ... we realized there might be an opportunity to smash all those barriers and truly globalize music.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/media/quibi-coronavirus/index.html,"Quibi, the on-the-go streaming service, says it could benefit from people staying home","However, many of its potential subscribers are no longer on-the-go, because they're stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Although it might sound counter-intuitive, Quibi maintains that it could actually benefit from that. The principal sales point for the new streaming service — which offers videos and series that are cut into segments shorter than 10 minutes — was to tap into breaks when people might be out and scanning their phones. What's unknown, at this point, is the extent to which that formula changes when more people are in the house, with ready access to TVs and computers. But millions of people are stuck home and in need of something new to watch. Quibi, with its surplus of fresh bite-sized content, could help fill that need, despite its original hook being more on-the-go than stay-at-home streaming. Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi's founder, told CNN Business that there's no question that the world has changed since the venture announced its business model, but that ""we probably have more in between moments now than we ever had before because we're all locked in our homes."" ""We're either in between homeschooling, trying to keep our kids entertained, trying to get through our emails, our video conferencing, our FaceTime, the eight snacks a day that we're all tempted to eat,"" Katzenberg said. ""We have more time than we've ever had before."" Andrew Hare, a senior vice president of research at media consulting firm Magid, believes that quarantines and stay-at-home behavior won't hurt Quibi, but rather could lead to lot more people sampling and downloading the service. ""Look at TikTok, Twitch, YouTube. Mobile video is on fire,"" Hare told CNN Business. ""There's plenty of people staying home watching different things in the same room."" But Hare added that for Quibi to build a customer base right now, they have to deliver on a ""captivating experience that will build fans long after quarantines and coronavirus have passed."" Luckily, Quibi is armed with a sizable war chest of content.  Whitman, the former president and CEO of eBay (EBAY), and Katzenberg, a Disney (DIS) alumnus and co-founder of DreamWorks, have attracted A-list talent to star in and produce shows, including Jennifer Lopez, Steven Spielberg and Chance the Rapper.  The service will launch with 50 original shows. It will be available starting April 6 — for $4.99 a month with ads, and $7.99 a month without ads — and comes with a 90-day free trial. Given the current cultural moment, certain kinds of Quibi shows might pop more than others, such as its quick-bite news content and meditation series, ""The Daily Chill,"" which could calm the nerves of stressed-out viewers. ""The entire fabric of our lives and culture and our society are turned upside down and inside out, and so I don't want to pretend suddenly we have the magic elixir for that,"" Katzenberg said.  But Katzenberg added that he thinks that ""quick bite, super-premium Hollywood quality content is going to resonate now more than ever."" Quibi was always going to have a lot of competition in the battle for attention. The short-term unknown is the extent to which the current stay-at-home dynamic potentially exacerbates that. Mindful of the appetite for content during this period, a number of smaller streaming services are offering free trials as an incentive to get consumers to try their offerings. The challenge for Quibi, according to Hare, is whether or not it can stand out among all of the options. ""How can you catch a consumer before they load up Netflix (NFLX) first or decide to play a video game?"" Hare said. ""They will need to capture the zeitgeist with a few shows. If they can get hot for a few weeks that can move them into the entertainment choice conversation. If they launch quietly, it will be a very long uphill battle for subscribers.""   ",3/27/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/tech/zoom-app-coronavirus/index.html,Zoom's massive 'overnight success' actually took nine years,"As the coronavirus pandemic has forced millions around the world to stay in their homes, the 9-year-old platform has emerged as the go-to service for not only virtual meetings and classroom lessons but happy hours, costume parties, church services, brunches, book clubs and romantic dates. Like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), it's also become a key part of internet culture: The Facebook Group ""Zoom Memes for Self Quarantines,"" with nearly 395,000 members, offers a steady stream of jokes, ranging from a video of a student pretending Zoom is glitchy to get out of a homework assignment to a professor starting a lesson with cameos from stuffed animals. From the start, Zoom aspired to stand out in a market of products that were probably more hated than loved. In a letter to shareholders included with its paperwork for going public a year ago, founder and CEO Eric Yuan talked about ""how unhappy"" people were with the videoconference tools on the market. But that was before the pandemic. Now video conferencing tools have gone from the punchline of a dry office joke to a vital social lifeline -- and perhaps none more so than Zoom. Zoom's free version can host up 100 video participants at once -- Microsoft (MSFT)-owned Skype's free model allows for 50 -- and features personalized tools, including the ability to pick from different backgrounds (whether it be the Golden Gate Bridge option or a picture you upload), change the camera angles, hold encrypted private calls, send direct messages and record sessions. If calls run over 40 minutes, users can pay $14.99 monthly for unlimited minutes; enterprise users are charged $19.99.  In recent weeks, Zoom has emerged as the most downloaded app on the Apple App Store, repeatedly breaking its download records. On Monday March 23, Zoom was downloaded 2.13 million times worldwide, up from 2.04 million the day before, according to app tracking firm Apptopia. Two months prior, the app had just under 56,000 global downloads in a day. The company launched in 2011 when Yuan left Cisco as a founding engineer on its WebEx video platform, one of Zoom's rivals. In April 2019, Zoom went public and fared better than splashier tech companies such as Lyft and Uber, which held their IPOs around the same time. Zoom shares surged 72% on its first day of trading, giving it a market valuation of $16 billion. As of Friday, Zoom was valued at more than $40 billion, or roughly as much as Uber (UBER). (Unlike Uber, Zoom is actually profitable.) From the start of its life as a publicly traded company, investors seemed to buy into Yuan's vision, as laid out his letter to shareholders: ""video is the future of communications."" But it looks like that future came much faster and more abruptly than anyone could have expected. ""This is a very critical moment,"" Yuan said on a conference call with analysts earlier this month. ""Overnight almost everybody read and understood they needed a tool like this."" There are downsides, however, to such rapid growth and the added attention that comes with it. Like more traditional social networks, Zoom now faces concerns about privacy and online harassment. Already, the phrase ""Zoombombing"" has emerged for when bored, quarantined trolls and hackers overtake public video chats by displaying graphic content or racist comments to cause a stir. Chipotle, for example, confirmed to CNN Business that during its new public video chat series, Chiptole Together, a Zoom participant broadcasted pornography to all attendees. The company has since switched platforms. The incident was first reported by the New York Times.  At the same time, Zoom must work to keep its service up and running amid surging demand for online communication tools and social networks that has strained far bigger platforms, including Facebook (FB) and its corporate sibling Instagram. To handle this surge, Zoom spokesperson Farshad Hashmatulla told CNN Business it relies on its data centers in 17 global locations, routing both audio and video traffic to these sites. He said the company's policy long before the health crisis has been to make sure it can support double its average daily peak of usage and have the ability to deploy tens of thousands of additional servers within hours if needed. ""We remain confident that our architecture is built to handle these growing levels of activity,"" Hashmatulla added.  'A moment of truth for the company' When Yuan, a son of mining engineers in China, left Cisco to launch a product that was easier to use and more customizable than competitors, another one of his key focuses was building a company culture around promoting ""happiness. ""Very early on, we spoke about customer experience and culture; two things he really cared about,"" said Quinn Li, senior vice president of Qualcomm Ventures, an early Zoom investor. ""He would write back to any customer that would write to him, which is very rare for a company CEO to do."" Li was impressed with Yuan's vision to build a product around technical precision from the ground up. ""Because of Eric's experience at WebEx, he knew the video communication space super well,"" Li said. ""He left to start Zoom because he wanted to launch the best user experience, so he architected the product early on to just do that."" Zoom now appears to be expanding its footing across industries quickly as the coronavirus pandemic continues. For example, the company is offering its services to K-12 schools for no charge in various countries. It also waived its monthly charge to all users in China. ""Zoom realizes it can accelerate their growth by several years right now,"" said Wayne Kurtzman, who tracks teleconferencing platforms for market research firm IDC. ""This is a moment of truth for the company by stepping up in a way to allow people to be productive and be human -- and right now, it is.""  Zoom is far from the only video chat app experiencing rapid growth. On Monday, Skype for iPhone had more than 500,000 downloads in one day; WebEx for iPhone had 89,000, according to Apptopia data. ""Companies including Cisco, Microsoft and Slack have also been prepared for the days something like this could happen, where they would see exponential sales and growth,"" Kurtzman said. Despite some technical bumps -- for example, Microsoft's chat and communications platform Teams experienced a major outage in Europe last week -- these key players have managed the growth remarkably well. But it is Zoom's ability to meet the needs of people working remotely and serve as a fun tool for socializing that has heightened it to rockstar status.  ""Zoom is seeing the biggest increase because its product is easier and more robust than others and it's at right time when people really need it,"" Kurtzman said. ""When it comes to work, people want the same ease of collaboration they get in the office or in person -- and [in many ways], Zoom delivers this."" Eventually, analysts say it will need to add new features to encourage people to pay for the service. For now, companies are largely cautious to roll out new tools as their remote teams get comfortable at home and remain focused on making sure everything works.  ""Zoom is an overnight success nine years in the making ... but has, in my view, prepared for the long [haul] to support users both now and with future growth,"" Kurtzman said.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/tech/instagram-coronavirus/index.html,Instagram's CEO is managing one of the world's biggest social networks from his garage ,"For years, Instagram has been synonymous with travel and experiences. Its users fill their feeds with carefully filtered and cropped photos of exotic locations and colorful venues. But now, from his plywood-lined garage, Mosseri, Instagram's CEO, is telling his users to do what he's doing: stay at home.  Over the past week the company launched a dedicated ""Stay at Home"" tab featured prominently in the Stories section at the top of its feed. As the name suggests, the feature offers a way for users to share updates on their stay-at-home life at a time as people in vast parts of America and across the world have essentially been not to go outside except for essentials to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  And it might actually help raise awareness of the need to stay in. Mosseri revealed Tuesday that the ""Stay at Home"" Instagram stories were so popular it almost crashed the site in the hours after it went live.  The fact that a well-intentioned new feature nearly took down the entire service is a reminder of just how many fires Instagram and Mosseri are working to put out at once amid the coronavirus outbreak. Among other pressing issues, he and his team must: keep their servers up and running while much of the world is forced to shift their lives online; try to encourage people on the platform to maintain social distancing; combating inaccurate and potentially dangerous misinformation about the coronavirus at a time when there is apparently an unprecedented amount of traffic on the site; and do all this while working outside the office. ""Having our workforce, particularly our moderators, work from home, is creating all sort of challenges that we need to work through,"" Mosseri said in an interview with CNN Business over Skype on Tuesday from inside the garage that is now his de facto command center.  ""Just generally, the amount of output we should be able to expect on a per person basis is just going to go down,"" he said. ""There is no way around that, which is why it is so important we get creative and make sure that we continue to make sure we keep people stay safe on the platform."" Mosseri added that the company still needs to stay on top of a range of challenges like content related to child exploitation and terrorism.  For years, Instagram's parent company, Facebook, has been trying to combat the spread of misinformation on its platforms. The coronavirus presents a whole new challenge as people around the globe are desperate for just about any information.  Instagram's struggles in dealing with the anti-vaccine movement might not inspire much confidence in the company's ability to get ahead of false information about the coronavirus.  But over the past few weeks and months it has brought in new rules and features specifically for the coronavirus crisis. Some of those features — like not recommending accounts that spread medical misinformation when people search terms related to the virus (which the company says will roll out in the coming days) — are steps critics of anti-vaccine accounts have been calling for for some time.  Mosseri said the company's focus has been getting users accurate information about the virus — links to official government agencies have appeared at the top of users' Instagram feeds around the world. The company, like other social media platforms, has taken other steps to highlight information from the World Health Organization.  ""I actually think search in general on platforms like ours gets way too much attention because it is not something people do that often. It is more important that people get good information when they come to the app in the first place,"" he said.  Like other companies, Instagram and Facebook instructed employees to work from home before it became mandatory in many states. ""We need to take care of our people if we are going to be able to help address the crisis and live up to our responsibility,"" Mosseri said. But new rules to tackle coronavirus misinformation and other initiatives, like banning ads for the sale of face masks (to help ensure they are available for medical workers in most need of them), require new protocols, staff training and sometimes new systems to implement, all of which is more difficult to do with staff working remotely.  As a result, Mosseri said Facebook and Instagram staff that don't normally work on moderation are volunteering to help. Twitter and YouTube also warned that the shift to working from home and reliance on automated content moderation may lead to more mistakes. The heightened anxiety felt by users will likely only amplify errors. For example, last Tuesday there were widespread reports of Facebook suddenly marking posts from users about everything from the coronavirus to their pets as violating the platform's rules. The problem was fixed within a few hours and Facebook said it had nothing to do with the changes in its workforce  With false claims about purported cures and preventative steps that can be take against the virus circulating online, ensuring the spread of accurate information is now literally a matter of life or death.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/media/trish-regan-fox-news/index.html,"Fox Business parts ways with Trish Regan, host who dismissed coronavirus as 'impeachment scam'","""We thank her for her contributions to the network over the years and wish her continued success in her future endeavors,"" the network said in a statement to CNN Business. ""We will continue our reduced live primetime schedule for the foreseeable future in an effort to allocate staff resources to continuous breaking news coverage on the Coronavirus crisis.""  The news of her departure was first reported by NBC News. Regan faced fierce criticism earlier this month when she described the coronavirus to her viewers as an ""impeachment scam.""  Regan claimed ""many in the liberal media"" were using the pandemic ""in an attempt to demonize and destroy"" Trump.  ""This is impeachment all over again,"" Regan said at the time, claiming Trump's critics were using the pandemic to spark panic and destabilize the economy to harm his chances of being re-elected.  Following the monologue, and the widespread criticism that ensued, the Fox Business Network removed her show from its lineup.  ""I have enjoyed my time at FOX and now intend to focus on my family during these troubled times,"" Regan said in a statement on Friday. ""I am grateful to my incredible team at FOX Business and for the many opportunities the network has provided me. I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my career."" Fox News and the Fox Business Network have come under fire in recent weeks for how its top hosts and personalities initially covered the coronavirus pandemic.  For weeks, they downplayed the coronavirus, with Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham telling their audiences that news coverage of the virus was aimed at hurting Trump politically. The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease. Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/success/what-is-a-furlough/index.html,What does it mean to be furloughed? ,"Macy's, Gap (GPS) and Kohl's (KSS) announced Monday they are furloughing workers, while hotel chain Marriott (MAR) also recently announced that tens of thousands of workers are facing a similar fate.  But what exactly does it mean to be furloughed and how does it differ from being laid off?  Layoff vs. furlough A layoff is a separation of employment that can be either temporary or permanent. This means the worker is not kept on the company's payroll, but could be rehired at a later date.  A furloughed worker is still considered an employee, but they have been forced to take a break from work without pay or to reduce their hours.  Furloughs tend to last less than six months since any period longer than that could trigger employment laws that mandate companies to provide the type of advance notification that can be required ahead of mass layoffs, according to Laura O'Donnell, partner at law firm Haynes and Boone.  Furloughed workers also usually get to keep their seniority status and return to the same pay level when they are brought back. Generally, furloughed workers' retirement benefits stay in place for as long as they are on the payroll, but the status of their health coverage can depend on the company's plans. Many require employees to work a certain number of hours to be eligible for coverage, but some insurance companies are loosening their requirements for furloughed workers due to the outbreak, O'Donnell said.  Kohl's, for example, said it will continue to provide existing health benefits to its furloughed associates, and Macy's (M) said furloughed workers who are enrolled in its health plan will receive coverage, with the company covering 100% of the premium through at least May.  Why do a furlough?  Furloughing workers is a cost-saving move that can help a company weather a rough patch.  The decision is usually temporary with the hope that workers will eventually be brought back once economic conditions improve.  It can also be good for morale.  ""If they are expecting it to be much more temporary and short term, it is easier to bring folks back than it is to go through the rehire process,"" said Michael Schmidt, vice chair of the labor and employment department at the law firm Cozen O'Connor.  What furloughed workers should know   While state laws vary, furloughed workers can usually apply for unemployment benefits, according to Schmidt.   Furloughed employees are not supposed to work during their time off and, unless you are contractually obligated to a company, you can still look for another job while being furloughed.  Also, employers cannot discriminate when it comes to who gets furloughed.  ""Companies want to make sure they are not discriminating or retaliating in their employment decisions, including who is getting furloughed and who is not,"" warned Schmidt. ""If it's not the entire workforce, make sure there is legitimate business interest in making the selection.""",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html,Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases. While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding. Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk, who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming. ""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email. ""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center. Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" — with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale — in less than three months. Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries. The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space. ""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report. It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.  As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University. Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.  Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable. ""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.  At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly. Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy."" Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",3/24/2020

She liked that she could walk around a Best Buy and pick up a laptop, knowing that the microchip or processor her company built was powering it.   Not everyone would have been so enthusiastic. When Su took the helm of AMD in 2014, its stock was heading toward an all-time low.  But Su, now one of the most powerful women in tech, likes a challenge. She says that's why she became an engineer in the first place. She had to make bold bets — some of which wouldn't begin pay off for five years — to turn AMD around. ""The reason it takes so long is it is extraordinarily complex,"" Su said. ""Our latest chip for data centers is actually 40 billion transistors ... you've got to get every single one of them right and there's just a lot of engineering to do that."" Su, who holds bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, decided the company would go big on building technology for high performance computing applications. That set AMD up to power crucial next-generation tech including cloud computing, data centers, artificial intelligence and gaming.  Those technologies are dominant in 2020. But Su had to start laying the groundwork in 2014.  Risky business The semiconductor industry is inherently risky. Each new product development cycle takes around three to five years, so companies must bank on the fact that the technologies they're creating today will be what customers are looking for a few years down the road, and that they will beat out products from rivals. And they can't be one-hit wonders. Nabbing high profile clients required creating a ""technology roadmap"" that would convince them the company could consistently roll out high-performing updates and new products. Related: See the 20 Risk Takers pushing global business forward ""The most important thing for us back in 2014 was, first, choosing the right markets that were good for technology, "" Su said. ""It's not what you do today but it's really what you do year after year, after year that people pay attention to."" The bets paid off. These days AMD is soaring. Since Su became CEO in October 2014, the company's shares are up more than 1,300%, despite the fact that AMD, like many tech companies, has taken hits from the US-China trade war and, more recently, from disruptions caused by coronavirus.   Last month, AMD's stock hit its record high around $59 per share. It was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2019, growing nearly 150% during the year.  Discovering what AMD is 'really, really good at' Several years before Su became chief executive, AMD had taken steps to cut costs by getting out of certain areas of business, including spinning off ownership of the foundry that manufactured its semiconductors.  When Su took over, some of her biggest decisions were about what not to do. ""It is really important when you're a technology company to decide what you are really, really good at because you have to be the best, number one or number two,"" Su said. ""It's all about focusing on, 'Hey, this is the DNA of the company, let us make it as great as possible in terms of what we can bring to the market.'""  But doing that also meant thinking critically about which areas AMD was less likely to dominate. The company decided not to pursue building technology for mobile phones or sensors for ""internet of things"" machines — promising areas of development but ones that fell outside of AMD's core competency.  Instead, the company decided to make a big bet on high performance computing architecture, including powerful computer processors and graphics chips for gaming, artificial intelligence, super computing and other ""bleeding edge"" technologies. AMD was building fast and powerful chips, and often undercutting its competitors on price.  The strategy was especially important for a company that, at the time, was struggling to carve out a niche for itself in an industry dominated by a relatively small number of key players.  AMD's products are so convincing that the US Department of Energy chose AMD's chips to power its supercomputer project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Its technology will also help to power the upcoming exascale class supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the kind of high performance computer crucial for nuclear deterrence.  'Tick Tock' Semiconductor companies long ran on what's referred to as a ""tick tock"" development cycle. Companies would alternate between improving the manufacturing process for chips, and improving the design details within the chips themselves. That way, if something doesn't work, it's easy to tell which piece of the system is broken. But AMD was desperate for a boost, so it decided to tackle both of those things simultaneously, creating an entire new product portfolio.  ""They made huge bets in terms of process technology, architecture and packaging,"" said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, comparing the success of the move to ""planetary alignment.""  ""It's a once-in-a-generation thing that you're able to do that.""Early on some potential customers questioned whether the company would be able to execute on such an ambitious plan.  ""There was a little bit of convincing,"" Su said. ""The way we approached it was: 'Look, let me tell you what I'm going to do and ...  it's going to take me three years before I have anything for you to look at, but I'm going to keep telling you, I'm going to keep showing you.' And that's really what we've done."" AMD released the first generation of the new product portfolios that resulted from those efforts, desktop processors called Ryzen and server processors called Epyc, in 2017 and just this year released updated versions.  ""The first generations of Ryzen and Epyc were kind of like, 'Okay, we think you did a good job here, what's the follow up?'"" said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. ""The second generation have now convinced the market that they are serious."" The company plans to release third generation products later this year.  AMD vs. Intel  While Su was turning AMD around, major rival, Intel, was sputtering.  Intel struggled to move from a 14 nanometer chip to a smaller, more powerful 10 nanometer chip. During that difficult transition, Intel's supply of 14 nm chips used in personal computers failed to meet demand last year — an issue that forced it to release an unusual public apology in November.  Meanwhile, AMD brought a processor equivalent in power to the 10 nm chip to market ahead of Intel, and developed a product architecture that allows it to keep costs low.   Intel's challenges have cleared the runway for AMD to grab a larger slice of market share in key areas. ""(Intel's) lack of execution and AMD's flawless execution has yet to play out in terms of the market share AMD is going to gain in the coming years,"" Mosesmann said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they captured half the data center market."" The data center market has become a priority for AMD, as a growing number of companies look to shift their operations to the cloud and as data intensive next-generation technologies, like 5G, begin to emerge. It's an industry that could present a $20 billion to $30 billion opportunity for semiconductor companies over the next few years, according to Mosesmann.  The next challenge: coronavirus Coronavirus — and the damage it has inflicted on economies around the world — has raised questions about what the future holds for many companies. However, Kewell said, semiconductor companies will likely benefit from the fact that their manufacturing and production processes are largely automated.  In the short term, coronavirus may even be a boon to the company as more people stock up on powerful laptops and gaming systems powered by AMD technology for work and entertainment at home, Krewell said.  AMD still likely has a significant runway to grow in the coming years.  ""It's a very, sort of, high stakes, high reward place and our goal is to continue to make the right bets year after year,"" Su said.  ""As proud as I am of what we've done over the last five years, there's no question in my mind that the next five years are going to be even more competitive and we need to make those bets. We're making a ton of bets now. Every day we talk about, 'Hey, how should we build our roadmap for the future?' And that's our world.""",3/27/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/sim-hack-million-dollars/index.html,One man lost his life savings in a SIM hack. Here's how you can try to protect yourself,"Ross was the victim of a SIM hack, an attack that occurs when hackers take over a victim's phone number by transferring it to a SIM card they control. By taking over his cellphone number, a hacker was able to gain access to his email address and ultimately his life-savings, Ross said in an interview with CNN Business.  ""I was at home at my desk and I noticed a notification on my iPhone for a withdrawal request from one of my financial institutions, and I thought, 'That's weird. I didn't make a withdrawal request,'"" Ross recalled. ""Then I looked back at my phone and I saw that I had no service."" In recent years, cybersecurity breaches have become so common that some consumers may almost take for granted their information has been compromised at some point. The list of massive data breaches includes a major hotel chain, a credit reporting firm, a bank and a social network. But SIM hacks are both less talked about and yet potentially more devastating. There is limited data on the prevalence of SIM hijacking nationally, but during the last year, the US Department of Justice has indicted numerous people for crimes associated with SIM swapping.  Some of the most high-profile SIM hijacks have targeted people with money stored in cryptocurrency exchanges. Ross had approximately $1 million stored in two exchanges when he was attacked, according to a report by investigators. An arrest was made in Ross' case, and the suspect has pleaded not guilty.  The attack on Ross followed a standard SIM hack playbook: The alleged hacker called up Ross' cellphone service provider, in this case AT&T. (WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN, is owned by AT&T.) Pretending to be Ross, the alleged hacker successfully convinced AT&T that he was Ross and took control of Ross' phone number, an investigation by authorities in California  later found. That's when Ross' own phone went dark.  Ross may have been using AT&T, but SIM hijacks have been reported on all major US cell phone networks.  How to try to protect yourself against SIM swaps Think of everything you do on your phone and everything that is associated with your phone number. When you forget your email passwords or have trouble accessing your online bank accounts, many services send you a text message with a code to help verify your identity — a form of multi or two-factor authentication. When a hacker gets access to your phone number, they get the keys to the castle. They potentially have the ability to take over a victim's social media and other accounts by using text message password recovery features. CNN asked the four major networks what steps their customers could take to protect themselves from SIM hacks. While all offered some options, few seem to have a solution that would provide complete peace of mind.  Sprint (S) appears to have the most comprehensive solution, requiring customers to complete two-factor authentication in order to SIM swap. The customer must first give a PIN number or answer a security question and then provide a one-time passcode that is sent to their device via text message. ""We strongly encourage our customers to protect and regularly update their passwords, and never share account details, names, or other personal information with a third party without verifying the request came from a trusted source,"" a Sprint spokesperson told CNN Business. An AT&T (T) spokesperson said the company advises against using mobile phone numbers as the single source of security and authentication."" AT&T encourages customers to add ""extra security"" measures to their accounts, such as creating a password.  A Verizon (VZ) spokesperson said it offers customers a ""Port Freeze"" that will prevent their number from being moved to another network. T-Mobile (TMUS) pointed CNN Business to a post on the company's website that outlines what its customers can do. In the event of an ""account takeover fraud,"" the company said it would ""work with customers individually to apply additional security measures."" Dealing with the fallout of a SIM hack More than a year after suffering the SIM hack, Ross is still seeking justice. He is suing AT&T for what he alleges was a failure by the company to protect his ""sensitive and confidential account data"" that resulted in ""massive violations"" of his privacy and ""the theft of more than $1 million,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Fraudulent SIM swaps are a form of theft committed by sophisticated criminals. We are working closely with our industry, law enforcement and consumers to stop and prevent this type of crime,"" an AT&T spokesperson told CNN Business.  ""It is unfortunate that Mr. Ross experiences this, but we dispute his allegations and plan to disprove them in court,"" the spokesperson added.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/success/ask-flexible-schedule/index.html,Many of us are now WFH. Here's how to ask for the schedule you need,"For parents who are now working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak, things have gotten a lot more difficult. Not only do they have new co-workers -- their kids -- but some also have to take on a new role as teacher. That means the standard 9-to-5 work day isn't realistic anymore. Even if you don't have kids, this new working reality can be challenging. Work schedules and expectations are going to have to shift as workers grapple with all their new responsibilities.  While many companies are being more flexible and understanding, it can still be difficult to approach your boss about adjusting your hours.  ""Be tactful and honest with your boss,"" said Mary Pharris, director of marketing and communications at Fairygodboss. ""I think most people are understanding during this time, as long as you keep open lines of communication."" Take a boss's eye view  Get one step ahead of your boss and identify any potential issues with your schedule request and be ready with a solution.  ""Shift to your boss's perspective and what he or she might be concerned about with this,"" recommended Marie McIntyre, a career coach in Atlanta and author of ""Secrets to Winning at Office Politics.""  For instance, your boss might be worried about communication or missed deadlines. So when you make your request, propose steps like sending a progress report at the end of each day or week and scheduling regular feedback meetings.  Know your goal posts The key to creating a successful flexible schedule is knowing what your boss expects of you.  ""Getting clarity and expectations on the priorities will help you be much more successful,"" said Ellen Faye, a productivity and leadership coach. ""It's really hard to play a game without knowing the rules."" Knowing what your boss expects helps you better manage your time to avoid last-minute crunches that could have you working all hours.  Keep it positive and honest This is new territory for all of us, so it's important that employees and employers try and work together to find compatible schedules.  If your boss asks to have a meeting at 9:00 am and that's right in the middle of the breakfast crunch, don't be shy about saying that's a tough time for you, but 10:30 would be better, said Faye. ""This isn't a time to have fear in terms of being honest about how you can be most productive and what your personal situation is,"" she said. Have a plan, but keep it flexible    Approach your boss with a tentative work schedule, along with your plan on how you will continue to meet your goals and deadlines. But you should also be flexible.   ""Go in with a proposal and say: 'given the current situation, as I've been working from home, I'd like to propose the following work schedule and ways of working because I think they'll enable me to be more effective overall. Does this work for you?,'"" suggested Hallie Crawford, a certified career coach.  Then detail the schedule, including times when you will be available and when it's tougher due to other commitments. Spread the word  Once your boss has signed off on a work arrangement, talk with your colleagues and any clients that might be affected by the change.  Be as transparent as possible with your new schedule to avoid confusion and projects being delayed. You can put up away messages on your email, Slack and other tools that alert people to when you are available. Adding a line in your email signature about your work schedule will also help set expectations. ""Over communicate, provide more context than you normally would have before, because since we're not all in the same office, it's like we're working in a bit of a vacuum,"" said Crawford. ""So fill that void with explanations of why something's being done the way it is. Be clearer about what people's roles are on a project and who is responsible for what.""",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/success/rent-help-coronavirus/index.html,Here's what to do if you can't pay your rent,"""I'll be able to pay this month, but not May or anything after,"" she told them. ""Rent depleted everything I saved."" Ramsey is more fortunate than many Americans who've lost their job and won't be able to pay their share of the nearly $50 billion in rent that's due today, according to the Urban Institute. She still has her job at a gas station in Circleville, Ohio. But her hours were cut from 40 a week to nine, taking her pay down to $88 weekly. She is also concerned about her exposure to the public, and has to care for her 5-year-old son, Garrett, who is home from school. ""I've always been able to pay my rent and I've never been late,"" she said. ""This is freaking me out. Everything is due at once. I can't even rob Peter to pay Paul.""  While government agencies and banks are offering aid to homeowners by suspending mortgage payments, getting direct relief to the country's 44 million renter households is harder. What help is there for those who can't pay the rent? Can the federal government help? Renters are more economically vulnerable than homeowners, said Solomon Greene, a senior fellow in housing policy at the Urban Institute. ""They make less money, they have less saved up to weather emergencies and they are at greater risk for displacement and homelessness than homeowners."" Most rental properties are owned by private landlords and therefore don't have direct exposure to the aid provided by federal government. But there are some renters, like those in federally assisted housing, who will receive relief from the government's $2 trillion stimulus bill, including a 120-day moratorium on evictions and late fees for people in almost all the nation's affordable housing properties. The stimulus bill also allows multifamily landlords with federally backed mortgages to receive forbearance on their payments. In order to get this forbearance, they can't evict their tenants. But Greene says this will help only a small share of renters. ""Most renters don't know what kind of mortgage their landlord has,"" he said.  Some housing experts say the most beneficial assistance for renters will be the direct payments the government is providing to Americans. But the stimulus payments are not expected for three weeks or more.  Millions are wondering how they'll pay their rent until then, said Justin Ruben, co-director of ParentsTogether, a parent run organization that is calling on Congress to freeze rents and stop evictions. ""Parents are telling us they won't be able to pay rent unless they cut back on vital food or medication."" Only 38% of parents said they'll be able to pay their full rent or mortgage on April 1, without cutting back on other necessities like food, according to a ParentsTogether survey that included 1,200 of its two million members. And just 30% are confident they'll be able to pay their May rent or mortgage. Help closer to home A better place to look for help may be your state, county or city, said Greene. At least half of states have temporary eviction moratoriums in place, and dozens of cities have adopted measures as well.  ""But the key message is that rent will still be due,"" said Greene. ""This is not a rent holiday. It is smart policy to issue these moratoria during a crisis, but it doesn't eliminate the need to pay your rent or the landlord's right to recover rent.""  In many cases, the burden is on the tenant to alert the landlord to their inability to pay. Tenants will be obligated to repay full rent in a timely manner and could still face eviction after the enforcement moratorium is lifted.  ""We don't want to see a wave of evictions as these moratoria are lifted,"" said Greene. ""We need to look at forms of emergency rent relief where philanthropy or government is covering the rent during the job loss."" Searching for services on a local level may help residents find legal aid or rent relief more quickly.  Some cities, like Oakland, California, have enacted stronger protections for tenants than the state. Through the Keep Oakland Housed program, for example, the city offers emergency financial assistance to help with rent, legal services or other housing-related costs. Be open about the struggle Talk with your landlord about your financial situation. You may find that your landlord has voluntarily adopted rent discounts or other accommodations.  Clay Grubb, CEO of Grubb Properties, a multifamily housing developer based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was disappointed to find ""Rent Strike 2020"" spray painted on one of his buildings.  ""It is a scary time,"" he said. ""People are trying to incite everyone not to pay. We want to give people some flexibility. But the rent is still due."" Grubb decided to offer a 10% rent discount to tenants who pay on time. He's also extending payment deadlines and split payments for those who missed the April 1st deadline. He will let them pay half the rent by April 10th and the other half by the 25th.  In Ohio, Brooklyn Ramsey is happy the rent is paid. For now.  ""This is something nobody can control,"" said Ramsey. ""There are a lot of people that are really struggling and who will be homeless if they can't get back to work.""",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/cars/truck-drivers-coronavirus/index.html,5 truck drivers share what it's like to haul critical supplies during a pandemic,"CNN Business spoke with several truck drivers about their recent experiences. Many said they're working under trying circumstances that include longer hours, crowded truck stops, difficulties finding food, as well as health and safety concerns. Still, they said they're energized by the challenge and thankful for the gratitude they are receiving from their fellow Americans.   Here's what they had to say:  (The following has been edited for clarity) Ralph Garcia  Based out of: Albuquerque, New Mexico Drives for: ABF Freight The 41 years I've driven, I've never seen the truck traffic, it's incredible. Places at night, trying to get parked. The other day I didn't want to stop because it was so packed. People were lined up on the off ramp, sleeping right there. They couldn't even get into the truck stop. It's getting hard to even get a sandwich in the past week, with states closing down restaurants. I thought that was insanity. They're doing takeout, at least they have that.  There's a restaurant that I always call ahead to so they'll have it ready. This time, they asked me if I could sit out in my truck. They brought it right to my truck. That was a first. The other day I went to Burger King in Kingman, Arizona. My truck doesn't fit through the drive-through so I stood in the drive-through. I made my order walking between the cars and they looked at me like I was some kind of crazy guy. The lady said, 'This is a drive-up.' And I said, 'Yeah, but I can't drive my semi.' She just kind of chuckled, and said 'We don't usually do this.' I said 'You're going to have to start, because we got to eat.' They didn't give me a hard time. Courtney Emery  Based out of: Crossville Tennessee Drives for: A FedEx contractor  I'm a little bit nervous [that I've been exposed]. It's definitely scary. When I go home off the road, I live with my grandparents. I'm afraid to go home and transport it to them.  Truckers aren't health care workers and we're not anybody special. We just have to keep working because, what else are we going to do right now? And people need their toilet paper. Dee Sova Based out of: Greenville Missouri  Drives for: Prime, Inc.  We've been a little bit more obsessive about hand cleaning and sanitizer. Because you just don't know. It's business as usual, with the acknowledgment we have to be super, super careful about hygiene.  It's already using hand sanitizer before we walk into the truck stop. Or we have gloves on. We're not touching surfaces right now. I'm trying not to touch buttons. When we're at the fuel island [to fill up] we're using a pen versus actually touching that surface. People are kinder now. My husband, who I drive with, took $70 into a Walmart Thursday to get what he needed. When he went up to the counter to ring everything up, it came to $78. This lady behind him gave him extra [money] to pay for what he needed to get. I realized that was human kindness at work on our behalf as drivers. She didn't have to do that. He could've came out to the truck, got the ATM card and covered everything, but she didn't waste any hesitation in giving him that extra money. Jorge Chavez  Based out of: Houston, Texas Drives for: Jetco Delivery I just dropped a full trailer loaded with milk. As a father, I got kids at home. I would feel bad if my family doesn't have whatever they need. Right now I feel proud, I feel good because somehow we're helping the community to make sure that they get whatever they need in their homes. Honestly, I don't feel tired. I just feel excited. What's happening now is impacting every family across the nation. I got friends that are driving from state to state. Everyone is doing their part.   Allen Boyd  Based out of: Bedford, Pennsylvania Drives for: Walmart  You always pay attention to who is following you. With all the stuff that's happening, now we really have to pay attention.  I talked to a driver last week who had somebody come up alongside him and blow on the horn and asked him to roll down his window. They wanted to know if he had toilet paper, as he's driving down the road.  You don't know how desperate people are. People do different things that they would never do when they need something really bad. Most of the time, we don't have a clue what's in our trucks. Even if we do know, we don't tell. You don't know what that person is going to do, how that person's going to react. In these times, we have to step up our game. In 39 years, I don't recall ever being thanked for just being a truck driver before. I appreciate being thanked for a change. I hope that it's not just during this time and when it goes away, we're back to just being in everybody's way again.  We make sure everybody has what they need everyday, and do it as safely as possible and in a timely manner.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/nightlife-coronavirus/index.html,Coronavirus is crushing New York City's bar scene and its workers,"The club's bills are still coming due. So are the rents of the nearly 100 people on staff, some of whom make most of their income in tips.   And many others are in the same position as Elsewhere. The businesses immediately affected by coronavirus -- hotels, arts, food, nightlife -- employ many people who cannot work from home. If they don't show up, they don't get paid.  When New York City banned gatherings of 500 or more people earlier this month, it was the first step in several to where we are now: 100% of non-essential workers have been mandated to stay home by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to slow the spread of coronavirus. ""That was really like Friday the 13th -- Day One of the very immediate crisis that nightlife is facing,"" said Dhruv Chopra, co-owner of Elsewhere. ""In terms of lost revenue, we're looking at easily two, three months just completely wiped out."" CNN spoke to several people who work across New York City nightlife, an ecosystem that supports jobs for almost 300,000 people and generates about $35 billion in economic activity annually. They all acknowledged the closing of bars and restaurants is necessary to slow the pandemic. But they say they're waiting for what they see as the second half of that policy: for the government to step in and support its workers while cashflow is at zero. 'Our industry collapse[d] in the space of 24 hours' Kip Davis, a freelance lighting designer, said he watched as the virus crushed the nightlife industry in Asia, then in Europe, knowing it would inevitably come to the United States. In early March, his colleagues started checking in with each other. They talked about their fears of unemployment, canceled gigs and ""when was going to be our last opportunity to make a few bucks before all this was going to come crashing down on us."" Not only have Davis' event jobs evaporated, but so have his gigs creating permanent installations for bars -- because owners are now worried they won't be able to pay rent. It's part of a chain reaction that's touched everyone from bouncers to club owners. ""I feel like we watched our industry collapse in the space of 24 hours. So panic ensued,"" said Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, a booker at Bossa Nova Civic Club in Brooklyn. Hutchinson is also the founder of Discwoman, an agency representing DJs who are mostly black and women of color. Both streams of income have stopped, and she's living off savings.  ""I mean, there's just no cash flow, between venues, promoters, artists,"" she said. ""It's really hard to know how to pick up after this, honestly. What is going to be left?"" Some bars are paying workers a stipend or sick leave, or raising money for them online through GoFundMe and Patreon.  ""If they're employed somewhere, maybe that business might be looking out for them,"" Davis said. ""But if they're self-employed, there's nobody who has their backs."" Seva Granik, an independent event planner and party promoter in Brooklyn, said he and his peers are ""all entirely out of any way of creating income."" He immediately lost $15,000 he'd invested in events that are now canceled. For John Barclay, it's 2008 all over again. Until that financial crisis, he was mostly working in journalism and publishing. ""Then the recession hit, and I had a part-time bartending gig and I just completely moved over to bartending and bar management because it seemed a lot more recession-proof."" He opened Bossa Nova Civic Club, a small dance club, seven years ago. ""Of course, I at the time was not considering pandemics at all,"" he said.  Barclay said he laid off the dozen people on his staff so they could quickly apply for unemployment insurance. Soaring unemployment claims A lot of people are in the same position as Barclay's workers. Almost 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance the week ended March 21. That's the highest number since the Department of Labor started tracking it in 1967. New governmental assistance programs are meant to help. But the math doesn't work in a city like New York, where one in four people spends 50% or more of their income on rent.  On the local level, New York state has suspended eviction proceedings, and New York City announced small business loans with zero interest and grants for businesses with less than five employees to keep paying them at 40% of wages. Nationally, the White House and Congress are working on a $2 trillion stimulus package that includes $1,200 direct payments to individuals who make up to $75,000, and $2,400 to married couples making up to $150,000, plus $500 per child. The payments decrease for people making more and stop for people making over $99,000 and couples making over $198,000.  But in a city with high housing costs, $1,200 won't go far. ""That thousand dollars disappears in a matter of hours because my rent is more than a thousand dollars,"" said Granik, the party promoter. ""What am I going to do for food for the next few months? What am I going to do for utilities for the next few months?"" The package also provides for unemployment benefits for four months and extends it to the self-employed, like Davis. But Davis said he still has many questions, like how the overwhelmed state labor department would handle all the claims. And he still wants a rent freeze -- he's able to delay paying his rent, but not indefinitely.  Davis said his landlord told him to go work for Amazon. But warehouse temp work and online fundraisers can't make up for the systemic problems made more obvious by the pandemic and the proposed aid package when it comes to nightlife workers. ""Wealth is not spread out evenly in the city or in the world in general,"" Hutchinson said. ""We're really going to see the results of that income inequality come to light during a crisis like this. Who's going to be left behind? Who's going to slip through the cracks?"" Beyond the economic issues, she added, there's a cultural aspect at risk.

Those limits were put into place as part of President Trump's 2017 tax reform bill.  The New York Times was the first to report this nuance in the stimulus bill, which can be found in a brief section on page 203 of the 880-page document. The Times also cited a draft congressional analysis that said this part of the stimulus bill would lead to $170 billion in tax breaks over ten years. Originally, the 2017 tax bill let wealthy investors use depreciation to offset the first $500,000 of capital gains from investments each year.  But according to an analysis from law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, taxpayers ""with unused losses arising in 2018, 2019 or 2020 that paid tax in one or more of the five preceding tax years will be able to immediately file amended returns.""  That is particularly beneficial for the real estate industry. And that fact is raising alarm bells given the ties that President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner have to that particular business. ""As if Jared Kushner's involvement in coronavirus response wasn't already preposterous enough...now we learn that there's a huge tax giveaway for people like him and his family in the stimulus package,"" said the nonprofit legal aid group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in a tweet. Senate Democrats have pointed out that the stimulus package bars The Trump Organization, which owns stakes in several hotels, golf courses and resorts, from receiving any direct aid via loans. The NAIOP, a trade group for commercial real estate developers, defended the stimulus bill, saying in a statement that new rules reverse an ""error"" in the 2017 tax overhaul that resulted in a 39-year depreciation period for expenses related to property improvement. The NAIOP added that the tax changes in the stimulus bill will be good for both landlords and their small business tenants. The fact that some industries might be getting what is viewed as a juicy tax break won't sit well with many Americans. But the rush to get a bill passed made such perks inevitable, according to Nela Richardson, an investment strategist with Edward Jones. ""To a certain degree the government is picking winners and losers in the stimulus bill and we will probably see it become even more political,"" Richardson said. ""But it is important for stimulus to be passed in order to put a floor on the financial hit from the coronavirus and stabilize the economy."" ",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/success/real-estate-coronavirus/index.html,"Buying, selling, closing. How to handle a real estate deal in a pandemic","Restrictions to movement, a plunging financial market and uncertainty about future income, all because of the coronavirus pandemic, have upended plans to buy and sell homes overnight. Real estate activity has slowed considerably as buyers, sellers and agents try to figure out the path forward.  Properties are still going into contract, but few new listings are coming on to the market, said Katerina Wilkerson, a real estate agent at Keeton and Company in Richmond, Virginia. ""People are nervous,"" said Wilkerson. ""They don't want to put offers in. What do these rate cuts mean? People who were going to sell are wondering whether they should."" Buyers she's working with were set to close on a home this week, but the house they are selling is not scheduled to close until next week. ""They are asking, what if we can't close next week?"" she said. ""They need that money. They can't be stuck with two mortgages.""  Should I sell? ""The spring market as we know it is not going to happen,"" said Matt Dolan, an agent at Sagan Harborside Sotheby's International Realty in Marblehead, Massachusetts. ""Life will go on and people will have to move, but it will be very different.""  He has seen nearly-done deals suddenly fall apart because sellers got furloughed and don't know what that means for their next purchase. While other people who were ready to write an offer have walked away.  ""There is fear. But there is awareness,"" said Dolan. ""People are starting to think about what this means, longer term."" But, he said, if you can get past those hurdles, it is a good time for buyers because they can get low interest rates and it is a good time for sellers because of low inventory. He said there are still even bidding wars for some properties. ""If you have a good house that is priced well you can sell it,"" he said. Showings have dropped off significantly because of public health recommendations to stay home, said Leonard Steinberg, an agent with Compass in New York City,  He's not taking the risk of showing anything right now. But, he said, if you've already listed, leave it. ""Don't take your property off the market,"" he said. ""Now more than ever, people have time to look for homes. Fewer distractions while they are stuck at home. There is a lot of online looking right now.""  Should I buy? Jeff and Lauren Nathan were ready to buy a house in Suwanee, Georgia, outside of Atlanta. But red flags are making them increasingly spooked.  They had a bid accepted on a home two weeks ago, but when the sellers wouldn't agree to their requested improvements -- $20,000 in new windows -- or to lower the cost, the Nathans got nervous and pulled out, losing their inspection costs.  They went to open houses even though people were being advised not to go out.  ""But those houses already had offers on them,"" Jeff Nathan said. ""It was crazy. There isn't a lot on the market, so maybe they are trying to get a bidding war going or secure backup offers."" Nathan described their status now as ""Zillowing,"" meaning they are paying attention, but not taking any action. ""We have to decide whether we want to buy right now, and I just don't know,"" said Nathan. ""I'd like to say we're taking it day by day, but it's really hour to hour.""  Can I close? Closings are the real problem right now, said Wilkerson.  Social distancing restrictions and business closures are making it hard for the people required to conduct a home closing to gather in one room. Plus, with some municipal buildings closed, recording a sale might not be possible.  But, as much as they are able, parties appear to be trying to make the closings work. Wilkerson said her local county in Virginia is recording closings remotely or by appointment. But if social distancing measures become more strict, that could make closings more difficult. ""If we move into a more [locked down] situation, in which people have to decide if appraisers and notaries can be sent out or not, it could be even more tricky.""  Some buyers who were already in contract may now be thinking of backing out of deals, but that's easier said than done.  ""If consumers have already sent in their earnest money deposit, there is a large financial cost to backing out,"" said Viral Shah, co-founder and head of financial products at Better, an online lender. ""If they decide to delay they will need to work with their lender, seller, attorney and agent to find out what the timing is. In this unprecedented time, we expect people to be reasonable."" But there are rules, regulations and laws that must be followed. And meeting all the criteria isn't always possible right now.  ""In Massachusetts, and other places, for example, you have to have a smoke detector certificate from the fire department in order to close on your home,"" said Dolan. ""Those inspections have been shut down for the next three weeks. That will interrupt closings."" Then there are other obstacles to consider. He has a client who, while traveling in New Zealand, was able to negotiate a purchase and sale remotely.  ""But we don't know if they will be able to make it back to close.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/tech/amazon-workers-coronavirus/index.html,Amazon warehouses are getting hit with coronavirus cases,"One person who works in Amazon's Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the online retail giant told CNN Business late Tuesday. The person, who was last at work physically on March 11, is in quarantine and recovering, Amazon said.  That case marks the second to affect Amazon warehouses in New York. It comes a week after the first reported case at any US Amazon facility, in Queens, NY. The company also confirmed a case at a facility in Joliet, Illinois, on Wednesday afternoon. Other positive cases have been reported at Amazon facilities in Moreno Valley, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Shepherdsville, Ky.; Brownstown, Mich.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Katy, Texas; and Wallingford, Conn. Amazon has temporarily closed some sites, such as the Queens location, but has largely refrained from mass closures. The company told CNN that it is taking ""extreme measures to ensure the safety of employees at our site[s].""  That includes regularly sanitizing door handles, elevator buttons, lockers and touch screens, Amazon said, as well as staggering shifts and spreading out chairs in break rooms.  The spread of the virus within Amazon's massive logistics operation may only add to the anxiety among workers who previously told CNN Business they felt Amazon should be doing more to protect the hundreds of thousands in its warehouse facilities across the US.  The additional cases also threaten to disrupt shipments and delay deliveries even as millions of Americans are becoming more reliant on the service as they are told to leave their homes as little as possible. The company is already warning visitors to its website of longer delivery times, and encouraging customers to select no-rush shipping if their needs are not urgent.  A CNN Business review of Amazon's website Wednesday morning showed delivery dates in mid-April for Amazon's white-label toilet paper. Digital thermometers, the site said, could be delivered by early May.  Amazon is witnessing spikes in demand that are comparable to the surge surrounding peak holiday periods such as Black Friday, Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president of global corporate affairs, told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview last week. In response, the company is ramping up hiring. ""We're boosting employment by 100,000 in the way that we do for seasonal periods like the holiday, when we need extra workers,"" Carney said. Before the dramatic rise in confirmed cases across the United States, Amazon represented a whopping 39% of the e-commerce industry, according to research firm eMarketer. Now that figure could rise even higher as Americans stop visiting brick-and-mortar stores. That's put increasing strain on Amazon workers themselves, some of whom have accused the company of ""recklessly endangering"" employees by not granting them paid time off. Earlier this week, Chicago-area warehouse workers said they successfully petitioned for paid time off, in a policy update affecting part-time and seasonal Amazon workers nationwide, but are still fighting to have that leave count separately from sick leave. One worker at the Staten Island facility told CNN Business Wednesday morning that despite confirming the positive case to the media, Amazon had not notified workers at the site through email, text message, call or update in the company's employee app — pointing to a lack of internal transparency. ""I realize we're all in uncharted territory but yes, I would have appreciated learning about the infected person from Amazon's HR Dept. and not from Reddit or Vice,"" the worker said. An Amazon spokesperson told CNN Business, ""We communicated to the employees verbally in socially distanced small group meetings."" The spokesperson has not yet responded to a follow-up question about how the company had communicated with employees who'd yet to come in for their next shift. Workers previously told CNN Business that Amazon's social distancing policies are unrealistic in warehouses, where tight conditions in locker areas force employees to ""walk sideways"" to pass one another.  Rina Cummings, a worker at the Staten Island facility, told CNN Business she felt a lack of control about the situation, saying few are washing their hands and that ""nobody is really coming around to ask people if they're OK, if they're feeling sick. I feel like they're not as proactive as they should be."" This month, Amazon said all employees placed in quarantine would receive two weeks' pay, and that Amazon contractors who tested positive for the virus could apply for up to two weeks' pay from a $25 million relief fund the company has established. In an internal memo posted to Amazon's corporate blog dated Saturday, CEO Jeff Bezos said the company has placed orders for ""millions of face masks"" meant for employees and contractors.  ""Masks remain in short supply globally and are at this point being directed by governments to the highest-need facilities like hospitals and clinics,"" he said. ""When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people."" For now that means Amazon warehouse workers and delivery people remain some of the most exposed, working on the front lines of the crisis in hopes of earning a paycheck and ensuring households can continue to get soap and paper towels delivered to their door.",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/tech/huawei-coronavirus-changes/index.html,Desk dining and mandatory health checks: How Huawei is returning to work,"The first question was often: ""Can you hear me?""  As for many companies in China, Huawei is having to find new ways to work under strict conditions aimed at preventing another upsurge in coronavirus cases. The world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and China's leading smartphone brand re-opened its Shenzhen headquarters and another office nearby in early February, after a government-ordered lockdown ended.  While the severe restrictions on travel and work have been lifted, daily office life has changed substantially. Over at Huawei headquarters, wining and dining clients is now impossible. The sales and marketing team, for example, can't invite executives from carrier companies to Shenzhen and usher them into a brand new exhibition hall showing off Huawei's 5G network equipment. The team now hosts virtual tours instead.  Health app Employees are having to form new habits. They have to complete a ""daily health check-in"" using a mobile app, before they're allowed to enter Huawei offices. CNN Business was sent images of the app by a Huawei spokesperson. Staff must confirm that they don't have a fever or any other coronavirus symptoms and that they are not in quarantine. If they forget to fill in the questionnaire, their employee ID card stops working until a manager gives the all clear. The impact is visible too, the spokesperson said. There are fewer buses shuttling people around Huawei's sprawling campus, and the ones in service have blocked off every other row to ensure people stay a safe distance apart. That means more employees are driving their own cars, and competing for spots in Huawei's staff parking lots.   Al desko dining Staff cafeterias are closed. Lunch boxes are delivered to a central point before being distributed around the building. Everyone has been asked to eat at their desks.  Huawei's new routine illustrates how even as China is trying to restart its economy as the outbreak there subsides, life is anything but normal.   If there's one positive lesson the company has learned from the pandemic so far, it's that ""you don't have to sit face-to-face to have a good meeting, and you don't really have to all sit in one room to have a good press conference,"" Xu said on Tuesday. While the immediate crisis may have passed, Huawei is now operating in a vastly different business environment. The pandemic has brought about ""new, unexpected challenges, like economic decline, financial turmoil and also shrinking market demand,"" Xu said. Smartphone sales in China collapsed this quarter, as the country practically ground to a halt to contain the outbreak.  Huawei has been working with clients around the world to ensure the internet can handle the surge in online activities, like virtual meetings and school classes, and streaming TV shows. Last year, the company reported annual revenue of 858.8 billion yuan ($121 billion), up 19% compared to a year earlier, with net profit of 62.7 billion yuan ($8.8 billion).  Profit growth slowed significantly compared to 2018, and Xu blamed the US blacklist barring Huawei from buying key American tech for the slump.  Looking ahead, Xu said 2020 will be a ""crucial year"" for Huawei, because it is still on that blacklist, which means the company's latest smartphones remain cut off from Google's (GOOGL) mobile services and popular apps like Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps. Meanwhile, with the coronavirus pandemic still fast developing ""we don't have the time yet to either forecast or evaluate how our annual numbers will look like,"" Xu said.  ""For 2020, we'll try everything we can to continue to survive,"" he added. ",4/1/2020

Russell warned that if more people arrive, it will stretch resources to a breaking point. He has asked the governor to put a travel ban in place, prohibiting all but essential workers from traveling to the island's East End. ""A new trend is taking place that puts our local residents at even further risk -- people seeking refuge from the metropolitan areas,"" Russell said in a statement. ""Our limited medical resources are overburdened and ... they are reaching capacity which has the potential of limiting access to local residents.... Southold should not be treated as someone's personal isolation unit."" While some city residents are already hunkered down comfortably at their part-time resort homes, others are still deciding whether to make a run to quieter, more open spaces that haven't been overcome by the coronavirus. But they should keep in mind that they may not be welcome.  A drain on local resources Full-time residents of resort areas are in the strange position of asking people to stay away from the places they are often in the business of promoting. In Ocean City, New Jersey, a popular beach resort area, the mayor has asked second-home residents to stay away and has all but banned short term rentals.  ""Although Ocean City ordinarily welcomes all visitors, at this time we must take all available steps to enforce social distancing recommendations and limit nonessential travel to Ocean City,"" mayor Jay A. Gillian said in a statement.  After people rushed to Newport and other coastal towns, Rhode Island Governor Gina M. Raimondo issued an executive order that anyone coming to her state from New York must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, among others, pushed backed against the order and Raimondo has since repealed that order, amending it to require self-quarantine for anyone coming from outside her state for non-work related reasons. Locals living in fear Some year-round locals are also reacting negatively to the onslaught of visitors they weren't expecting so early in the year.  ""There is the full range of emotional responses to the influx of people,"" said Laura Roosevelt, a writer and full-time resident on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. ""Ranging from, 'I kind of wish you weren't here, but I'm not mad,' to others who are furious that people have invaded and perhaps infected the island."" She started noticing the uptick of people on the island when her seasonal friends, who were not expected until summer, began showing up over the past few weeks. ""I can think of six of my own friends with families who are here that normally aren't.""  But, she said, her friends have a home on the island, too.  ""If I were a person who bought a house and it was my favorite place, I would feel like, 'why do I have that house if I can't use it at a time like this?'"" Roosevelt said.  The comment sections of area newspapers and local online groups have lit up with frustration about the strain on services, particularly medical resources.  One commenter on the Martha's Vineyard Times website posted: ""Vineyard should be on full lockdown except for the ferries bringing food and supplies to the Island. With only 25 hospital beds and limited medical professionals to handle an influx of people trying to escape the coronavirus, the Island would be overwhelmed."" Looking for refuge Despite warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay where you are, including a domestic travel advisory for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, families still wonder if they could make a run for greener pastures. Real estate agents from Connecticut to the Hamptons are fielding a steady stream of calls from New York City residents looking for a refuge. ""Everyone is working from home. They are looking for some sort of relief from the city, a little more space, a yard for the kids,"" said Mary Ellen Gallagher, a Connecticut real estate agent with Compass. In her area, near Fairfield and Westport, short-term, furnished rentals are not typical. Gallagher is reaching out to her network of realtors and clients looking for rental homes to meet the demand. ""We're scrambling,"" she said.  Rentals in the Hamptons are in demand, too, said Joseph Kazickas, an agent at Rosehip Partners in East Hampton. ""We have been reaching out to landlords asking if they are able to rent their house immediately based on what is happening in New York,"" he said.  But is it a good idea for people to go? Kazickas said social distancing measures allow him to sell and rent properties. But he says if you want to follow current travel advisories and be respectful to communities, look at a summer rental. Martha's Vineyard was where Kristen Kusama-Hinte and her family were headed after New York City public schools closed.  ""We didn't think everyone was thinking the same thing,"" she said. ""But we realized that it wasn't such an original idea.""  And soon they wondered if it was even a good idea. ""Our kids were going to feel more comfortable in Brooklyn,"" she said. ""We didn't want to feel like we were just bailing on everyone in New York. Even if the hospitals are clearly overwhelmed here, the hospital on the Vineyard would be terribly overwhelmed. We didn't want to strain their resources.""  They decided to stay put. But she longs for the comfort and natural surroundings of their home on the Vineyard. They are thinking about going up in June and staying for the summer.  ""For everyone's safety, we want to be sure we're acting in a neighborly way and have that go both ways."" ",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/success/small-business-sba-loans/index.html,What small businesses need to know about the government's new forgivable loan program,"Nearly $350 billion has been allocated for that purpose in the new economic aid package signed into law last week. But most lenders may not be able to start processing loans today because it was just Thursday evening that the Treasury and Small Business Administration put out some of the critical guidance lenders need. ""[W]e would ask for everyone to be patient as banks move heaven and earth to get a system in place and running to help America's small businesses,"" said Richard Hunt, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association. The American Bankers Association also urged patience, noting it ""will take some time before [the program] is fully functioning."" Despite a bumpy start, lenders expect to see huge demand for the loans. Chris Hurn, CEO of Fountainhead, a non-bank direct Small Business Administration lender, estimates his company alone already has loan applications lined up for more than $1 billion. The Consumer Bankers Association expects the majority of its members to be operational by next week. And there are some lenders that are at least starting to accept applications. Here's what small business owners need to know about the new loan program. Who is eligible to apply?  Generally, any small business with 500 or fewer employees is eligible.  That includes sole proprietorships and independent contractors. It also includes nonprofits, veterans organizations and tribal businesses.  In certain circumstances, businesses with more than 500 employees also may qualify. Applications will be accepted up to June 30. But the program is on a first come, first serve basis. What is the money for?  The goal of the loan program is to help small businesses continue to pay their employees and their overhead costs in order to stay afloat for the next couple of months. So long as you use the borrowed funds to make payroll and to pay expenses, such as utilities and your rent or your mortgage interest, you won't have to repay the loan and you will not owe income tax on the forgiven amount. In order for your loan to be fully forgiven you must maintain your headcount and not reduce employees' pay. But I had to let my employees go already. Does that mean I can't get a loan?  You still can, so long as you can show you had employees as of Feb. 15, 2020. Once approved for a loan, you can use the money to rehire your staff. The loan forgiveness provisions will apply so long as employees are rehired by June 30, according to senior Treasury and Small Business Administration officials.  What do I need when I apply? Lenders will ask you to fill out a two-page application, which can be found here. You must show lenders proof that your company was in operation on Feb. 15, 2020 and that you had employees for whom you paid salaries and payroll taxes.  In addition, you'll need to show proof of your average monthly payroll costs in 2019 (or for the first two months this year if your business is new).  Independent contractors and the self-employed, who must wait until April 10 to apply, need to show proof of ""payroll and other certain expenses"" according to Treasury. You will not have to provide a personal guarantee or collateral to secure a loan, as you normally would for an SBA loan. But if you use the money for fraudulent purposes you will be subject to criminal charges.  You will not be charged loan fees. How much money can I get?  Loans will be made in an amount equal to 2.5 months of your average monthly payroll costs in 2019 (or the average of the first two months of this year if your business is new).  More details on just what goes into calculating your payroll costs can be found here starting on page 8. Only one loan is permitted per business. Does the money need to be paid back? You will not have to pay back the loan so long as you use at least 75% of the money you get on payroll costs (including wages, benefits, payroll taxes plus state and local wage taxes). and the rest of the funds are spent on your business' rent payments or mortgage interest, utilities and other overhead expenses. The money must be spent in the first eight weeks after you receive the loan. In other words, if you spend the borrowed money for authorized purposes over the first two months of the loan, that obligation will be forgiven. And the amount forgiven will not be treated as taxable income to you. At the end of eight weeks, you'll have to show your lender proof of your expenses during that period. Payroll costs eligible for forgiveness may not exceed $100,000 per employee. When would I have to pay the loan back if it's not forgiven? If any part of the borrowed money is used for unauthorized purposes, that amount will not be forgiven. And you will have to repay it over two years at a 1% interest rate. (Initially the Treasury had capped it at 0.5%m but many lenders noted that was below their cost of funds or breakeven point.) There's an automatic six-month deferral on payments for all borrowers. So you would need to start paying it back, with interest, after six months. Where can I get the loan? All SBA-approved lenders as well as federally insured depository institutions, federally insured credit unions and Farm Credit System institutions will be able to make these loans if they choose. Senior Treasury officials said they are also looking into allowing some fintech companies to make loans as well. The SBA will be posting a tool for you to key in your zip code to find lenders near you participating in the program. If you've never taken out an SBA loan before, you might go to your primary bank first because lenders will be operating under so-called Know Your Customer regulations and that process will be streamlined if you've previously worked with the lender.  Do I have to go to a bank to apply? No. The expectation is that you should be able to apply online. Is it true that I can get the money the same day I apply? Possibly, at some lenders. But it's more reasonable to assume it could take two to three days after you submit an application, Hurn said. It's up to every bank to decide when it disburses the money after an application is approved.  This loan will only support two months of my costs. Then what? Good question. If the coronavirus crisis goes on for a long time, the Treasury and Congress will need to come up with more ways to provide capital to keep small businesses afloat. Where can I go for more information? For more detailed information on the loans, guidance put out so far by the Treasury and the SBA can be found here and here. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that mortgage payments would be forgivable under the SBA loans. Only the interest portion of the mortgage payments will be covered.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/investing/bill-ackman-coronavirus/index.html,Bill Ackman: Shut down the economy for a month ,"""The interests of the economy and the interests of the health care system are really identical here,"" Ackman told CNN's Christine Romans in a new episode of the CNN podcast series ""Coronavirus: Fact vs Fiction."" ""The economy will recover quickly if we can shut down the virus. And the way to shut down the virus is the ultimate in social distancing, i.e. a total country shutdown."" Ackman said the proposal isn't radical: Many states are already implementing stay-at-home orders, except for essential businesses, such as grocery stores and hospitals. But Ackman believes that should be implemented across the country. ""What I'm proposing is a 30-day lock-in to the entire country, a coordinated 50 state lockdown,"" he said. ""It allows companies to plan for the future as they don't need to fire employees, particularly with the government backstop.... I call it the rip-the-Band-Aid-off strategy."" Ackman said he's spoke with CEOs of large banks, asset managers and food businesses, and they are unanimous in their support for this plan.  His strategy is similar to President Donald Trump's, who has pledged to open the US economy for business after Easter. Ackman's plan would keep the economy closed for a couple more weeks. And it would mandate stay-at-home practices across the entire country, rather than leaving those mandates up to the states. But both Ackman and Trump said they're concerned shutting down the economy for too long would ultimately hurt people more than the coronavirus. ""You know, the president himself said he doesn't want the cure to be worse than the problem,"" Ackman noted. ""Do we risk sort of dragging this out and really crushing capitalism if we can't fix it now and then move on and have it behind us? Yes. So the president is right."" The problem with that strategy is epidemiologists are unconvinced that a couple weeks or a month is sufficient time to control the outbreak. Parts of China, for example, were in lockdown for longer, and critics have said the country's decision to ease restrictions could cause the virus outbreak to run rampant again.  Those fits and starts could pose an even greater threat to the US economy than if stay-at-home orders were put in place until scientists agreed it was safe to return. If the country had to re-enter lockdown, the American economy could plunge into a Great Depression, some economists argue. Ackman, however, is hopeful. He said he and his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, have been buying up stocks -- about $2.5 billion worth -- in the past week, as values have plummeted in a sharp sell-off.  ""We bought a large hedge that became much more valuable when markets declined,"" Ackman said. ""And over the last 10 days or so, we've been aggressively buying stocks that have been marked down. So we've been, you know, betting that the economy is going to recover and that great companies like a Starbucks ... and other consumer type franchises that we've specialized in are going to are going to recover from here.""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/economy/coronavirus-debt-deficits/index.html,Get ready for wartime levels of national debt and tough choices ahead,"In most countries, political opposition to spending increases funded by borrowing has vanished in the face of a potential global depression. But the trillions of dollars in support promised to households and businesses will push up budget deficits to their highest levels since the global financial crisis.  And the borrowing binge could result in national debt mountains to rival those last seen in the late 1940s.   The amount of stimulus already committed ranges as high as 20% of GDP in some countries, but economists warn that even more will likely be needed to support workers and companies harmed by the pandemic. At the same time, tax revenue will decline along with economic activity, blowing out deficits even further.  Deficits in many developed economies are already expected to rise by 4% to 8% of GDP this year, with Germany and the United Kingdom near the top of the scale, according to Vicky Redwood, a senior economic adviser at Capital Economics. The United States, Canada, Italy and France are also among the big spenders.  Redwood said that deficits could widen further because ""government measures are still rising by the day,"" and national shutdowns designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus could go on longer than assumed. Government guarantees on loans to struggling businesses could also prove more costly than expected.  Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank who is credited with saving Europe's single currency during the continent's debt crisis, said recently that governments must absorb, wholly or in part, the loss of income suffered by the private sector. ""Much higher public debt levels will become a permanent feature of our economies,"" he wrote in the Financial Times.  Draghi argued that countries have always deployed their balance sheets during emergencies to protect citizens and absorb economic shocks that the private sector cannot. Wars — the best precedent for the coronavirus pandemic — are almost always financed by increases in public debt, he added.  Debt levels not seen since World War II In the United States, the wave of stimulus spending could push debt as a share of the economy to levels not seen since the end of the World War II. Congress has already approved three rescue packages, the most recent of which came with a $2 trillion price tag, and more may be needed.  Spending increases and tax cuts have already pushed US government debt up to $17 trillion, doubling the country's debt to GDP ratio to nearly 80% since 2008. According to Commerzbank, the coronavirus relief packages approved so far will push that figure to 96% by 2022.  ""Should Congress pass further aid packages and should the economic damage be greater than previously assumed, the previous record set in 1946 (106%) could be surpassed,"" Bernd Weidensteiner, one of the German bank's economists, wrote recently.  Other countries are rushing to secure funding for their pandemic rescue plans. Britain intends to auction £45 billion ($56 billion) in government debt in April alone. That's the highest monthly total on record, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, said that coronavirus has quickly ended a debate within Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party over whether he should increase spending after years of austerity. Ministerial aides admit privately the country is likely to emerge from the crisis with government debt at more than 100% of GDP, according to Rahman. Bringing down the debt Financial markets should easily absorb this new wave of debt, especially because central banks have committed to buying huge amounts of government bonds as part of their own stimulus efforts.  Economists aren't worried about the short-term effects of this massive splurge. The prospect of rising inflation caused by waves of stimulus, for example, isn't much of a concern because consumer demand is likely to remain subdued during the recession, even when lockdowns are eased or lifted.  But once the crisis passes, the accumulated debt will remain on government balance sheets. The more debt a country has, the more it has to spend to service that debt, leaving less money for other things. Low interest rates have helped the US government to keep its bills down, but rates could rise in the future. Countries that want to reduce their debt levels will likely have to do so over decades. In the United States, debt levels came down quickly after World War II because the economy was growing rapidly and annual deficits were kept low. A growing workforce helped, too.  The children born during those boom times are now growing older, meaning that demographics are working against the United States, as well as countries such as Italy. Government spending on health care, for example, will need to increase drastically in the coming years. Another limiting factor: The coronavirus could leave deep scars on the economy, suggesting that even modest growth might not return for years.  ""This will not be a recovery that resembles anything like what we saw after World War II, unfortunately,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that tracks federal spending from Washington. MacGuineas said that lawmakers should make tough choices now to help bring down the deficits of the future.  Tough choices ahead ""If we give everyone checks, we should pair that with raising the retirement age starting 10 years from now,"" she said. ""If we start to engage in infrastructure, we should pair that with raising the gas tax ... once certain metrics in the economy show we're strong enough to do it."" Countries with similar levels of debt to the United States but more limited growth prospects will have an even tougher time, according to Capital Economics' Redwood. She said those countries might be forced to heavily cut spending after the crisis in order to reduce their deficits. Another option for some would be to allow inflation to rise, which can spur growth and reduce the real value of debt. A third route is default.  ""We expect some emerging markets to go down this route, and Italy may end up doing this eventually too,"" said Redwood.",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/19/business/mcdonalds-oil-3d-printing/index.html,A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"Simpson is director of the school's Environmental NMR Center dedicated to environmental research. Central to this research is an analytical tool called the NMR spectrometer. NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance and is technically similar to how an MRI works for medical diagnostics. ""We use the NMR spectrometers to look inside tiny living organisms and understand their biochemical response to their changing environment,"" said Simpson. The overarching aim is to ""help bridge the gap between medical research and the environment."" Simpson had bought a 3D printer for the lab in 2017. He hoped to use it to build custom parts that kept organisms alive inside of the NMR spectrometer for his research. But the commercial resin he needed for high-quality light projection 3D printing (where light is used to form a solid) of those parts was expensive.  The dominant material for light projection printing is liquid plastic, which can cost upward of $500 a liter, according to Simpson. Simpson closely analyzed the resin and spotted a connection. The molecules making up the commercial plastic resin were similar to fats found in ordinary cooking oil.  ""The thought came to us. Could we use cooking oil and turn it into resin for 3D printing?"" Simpson said. Only one restaurant responded -- McDonald's What came next was the hardest part of the two-year experiment for Simpson and his team of 10 students -- getting a large sample batch of used cooking oil. ""We reached out to all of the fast-food restaurants around us. They all said no,"" said Simpson.  Except for McDonald's (MCD). In the summer of 2017, the students went to a McDonald's location near the campus in Toronto, Ontario, that had agreed to give them 10 liters of waste oil.  Back in the lab, the oil was filtered to take out chunks of food particles. Rajshree Ghosh Biswas is a second year PhD student working in Simpson's lab. She joined the team that was experimenting on McDonald's cooking oil in the summer of 2018. She was tasked with synthesizing small batches of the oil to try to convert it into high-quality resin.  Each time the resin was produced it was used to 3D print a butterfly. The breakthrough came in September.  The team successfully printed a high-quality butterfly with details as minute as 100 micrometers in size. ""We did analysis on the butterfly. It felt rubbery to touch, with a waxy surface that repelled water,"" said Simpson. He described the butterfly as  ""structurally stable."" It didn't break apart and held up at room temperature. ""We thought you could possibly 3D print anything you like with the oil,"" he said. The experiment yielded a commercially viable resin that Simpson estimates could be sourced as cheaply as 30 cents a liter of waste oil. Simpson was equally excited about another benefit of the butterfly the team had created.""The butterfly is essentially made from fat, which means it is biodegradable,"" he said.  To test this, he buried a sample butterfly in soil and found that 20% of it disappeared in a two-week period. ""The concept of sustainability has been underplayed in 3D printing,"" said Tim Greene, a research director for global research firm IDC who specializes in the 3D printing market. ""The melted plastic currently being used as resin is not so great for the environment."" ""This is also a great way to reuse and recycle waste cooking oil,"" said Ghosh Biswas. Terri Toms, the McDonald's franchisee who gave the oil to the students, agreed. ""I was impressed by the research initiative and happy to contribute to something that could possibly be helpful to future generations,"" said Toms. Simpson's team is no longer getting oil from McDonald's, but it hopes the research gets noticed by the industry. Simpson and his team published their research in December 2019 in industry publication ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. In it, they wrote that ""every year, it costs millions of dollars for fast food restaurants to process waste, including waste cooking oil. ""Most recycled waste cooking oil is currently used in the production of soap and biodiesel. It may be transformative for recycling programs if high-value commodities [such as resin]can be manufactured directly from it,"" the paper said. McDonald's has taken note.  Leanna Rizzi, a spokeswoman for McDonald's Canada, said the company learned about the outcome of the experiment, which it called ""a great initiative, when the research was published last month. Rizzi said the world's largest fast-food chain has a global sustainability program called ""Scale for Good,"" which includes initiatives to tackle plastic pollution and its used cooking oil. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Portugal, McDonald's converts its waste cooking oil into biofuel for use in its own delivery trucks.",3/24/2020

""A ventilator supports a patient who is no longer able to maintain their own airways, but sadly there is currently a significant shortage, both in the UK and other countries around the world,"" Dyson wrote. Dyson said the company had designed and built an entirely new ventilator, called the ""CoVent,"" since he received a call 10 days ago from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""This new device can be manufactured quickly, efficiently and at volume,"" Dyson added, saying that the new ventilator has been designed to ""address the specific needs"" of coronavirus patients. A spokesperson for the company, which is best known for its vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, said the ventilators would be ready by early April. Dyson, who has wealth worth $10 billion according to Bloomberg, wrote in his letter that he would also donate 5,000 units to the international effort to tackle the pandemic.

The company specializes in cordless vacuum cleaners and garden power tools.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/success/is-federal-stimulus-enough/index.html,"These Americans say $1,200 isn't enough. But it's better than nothing","Single Americans would receive $1,200, married couples would get $2,400, and parents would see $500 for each child under age 17. The payments begin to phase out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes over $75,000, and those making more than $99,000 would not qualify at all. The thresholds are doubled for couples, with those making more than $198,000 ineligible. But for the average American who was already struggling to pay their bills and now faces job loss or an uncertain future, the payments likely won't be enough.  Stimulus will be a 'tiny little drop' in the bucket Ryan Greene says he needs the government's help, but it won't go far enough. Greene was laid off from his security jobs at a couple nightclubs in San Francisco following the city's shut down. His wife, Jenn, who works at an audio visual equipment rental company, lost her income when her business closed. She's worried she may lose her job permanently. The couple has gone from earning more than $8,000 a month to a fraction of that amount and they are now struggling to pay their bills.  ""The stimulus money is a dirty Band-Aid because I know it isn't going to heal me,"" Greene said. ""I'm hemorrhaging right now and I'll take it. But it isn't going to make me whole or give me back what I lost."" Greene loved his job working the door at nightclubs, despite the $30 round-trip commute via ride-share, ferry and electric scooter from his home in Vallejo, California. He's managed to secure another job working the door at Whole Foods, one of the handful of companies still hiring, and he's thankful to have the work. But he's still earning less than half of what he was at the nightclub. The cost of living in the Bay Area alone will eat up much of the up to $2,400 the couple could receive.  ""I don't think a stimulus is going to help me much,"" said Greene. ""My rent is $2,200. A $1,200 check is just a tiny little drop that we have to sip slowly."" And then there are the health concerns about working with the public.  ""I am terrified,"" he said. During his first day on the job Wednesday he got a taste of what it will mean to tell people who are nervous about getting food and supplies that they have to wait their turn to get in the store and mind their social distancing. With only a few shoppers allowed in at a time, people started getting upset that others in line were too close to them, he said. Greene was rattled. ""But I have a job."" It's 'better than nothing' Lakeima Esaw is a para-professional at a public school in Rochester, New York. Though she is still being paid while schools are closed, she has not been able to set up a job over the summer as usual and so far will not have any income when the school year ends. Her paycheck-to-paycheck cash flow is running tighter with all three of her sons, ages 18, 16 and 9, home as well.  As a single taxpayer she expects to receive a $1,200 direct payment and a total of $1,000 for her two children who are under 17. ""It won't be enough,"" said Esaw. ""But something is better than nothing."" The money is already spent before it even arrives, she said. ""I would put that toward my rent,"" Esaw said. Her rent is $1,100 a month and the rest would go to food. ""Food is scarce,"" she added. ""That would help a lot because the kids are home and need to eat."" Her children's school offers food for students, but she said it is not enough.   ""They are giving grab-and-go food, but it isn't a hot meal,"" she said. ""Kids don't want to eat a sandwich every day.""  Esaw said she has spent an additional $300 on groceries over the past few weeks.  She's also concerned about how long it will take for the money to arrive. According to the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Americans could see checks within three weeks, but other experts predict it will be much longer. ""For my community, it is a big struggle,"" she said. ""Most of us live paycheck to paycheck and we need the money."" Help for families already on the edge ""The economic crisis is a tsunami bearing down on American families,"" said Justin Ruben, co-director of ParentsTogether, a national parent-led organization supporting families. ""Millions are already in danger of going under."" Already, 80% of parents are worried about having enough money to cover basic housing and food costs within the next three months, according to a ParentsTogether survey that included 1,400 of its two million members. Nearly half are worried about running out within the next two weeks. For April Balfoort, a single mom on disability with two special needs children, ages 2 and 6, who lives in Fort Johnson, New York, the payment will be a welcome relief in a life disrupted. She could receive a payment of as much as $2,200. ""Any bit would help,"" she said. ""But it won't solve the immediate supply and demand problem in the stores right now."" As someone on a fixed income, she knows precisely the price of the products she buys every week, and she has seen prices go up. She's also been faced with uneven options on the shelves -- many have only premium brands left that cost more. ""It cost us an extra $200 for basic supplies just this month and that meant putting bills aside,"" Balfoort said. She hopes workers who have no income would get their checks first.  ""They have nothing, totally nothing,"" she said. ""I just don't want to be kicked out of my home. I want to be able to pay my bills. And buy food for my family.""",3/30/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/success/small-businesses-coronavirus/index.html,Social distancing is hammering these small businesses ,"That's because the very nature of what they do depends on the large gatherings and person-to-person contact that are now forbidden in society's attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. Think of any personal service business, such as hair and nail salons or spas. Think of any home-based service, like housekeeping and handyman jobs. Think of any type of business that serves corporate events, weddings and big parties -- almost all of which now have been canceled or postponed. Now consider that many of those businesses could be tapped out in a few weeks. And many of their workers are either self-employed, with no option for unemployment benefits, or are paid hourly and live paycheck to paycheck with a heavy reliance on tips. Bars  Bars have been among the first and hardest hit, given that several cities have now shuttered them outright. T. Cole Newton owns two bars in New Orleans. He's had to close both, although one of them has a kitchen so he's trying to ramp up a takeout business. In the process, Newton has had to let a lot of people go and he worries his bars won't survive long in a world of social distancing.  Nor does Newton think a lot of bartenders will stick around for a recovery.  ""Bartending is a job that will effectively cease to exist. I think we'll lose a lot of people. This is forcing them to reevaluate their career choices,"" he said. Small beauty businesses  In the beauty industry, many small salons ""are a payroll away from illiquidity,"" said Frank Zona, who sits on the board of the International SalonSpa Business Network. Zona considers himself better off than most. He estimates he has eight weeks of liquidity for the three salons he owns in the Boston area, which he chose to temporarily close this week. So he's now actively trying to strike deals with suppliers and secure loans to extend that period.  His hairdressing business, which employs 70 people to whom he provides health insurance and paid family leave, has been in his family for over a century. But about 80% of hair salons, he said, are primarily staffed by self-employed stylists who rent a chair. Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association, concurs that for many small hair and nail salons, ""cash flow for even two weeks will be a problem. A month will be a breaking point for many.""  On the bright side, Sleeper said, clients are loyal and the industry is ""incredibly resilient. People will do everything they can to help each other."" But when things do start coming back, he noted, ""with the overall economy impacted, that will affect the number of visits to the salon and how much [customers] can pay."" Home care services  As with personal care services, home care is another area where close proximity -- if only to everything in one's house, if not to those living there --  is unavoidable. At Zen Home Cleaning, a New York City-based green cleaning service that also offers professional organizing and moving help, there have been some cancellations so far and CEO Deanna Hains expects more to come.  Some clients have offered to pay their regular cleaners for the canceled appointments.  Zen Home's cleaners, who are paid hourly, now wear gloves, masks and booties when they enter a client's home, she said. Still, Hains noted, she doesn't insist anyone on her team go to a job if they're not comfortable.  She doesn't have the means to pay them for very long if she has to shutter the business under city order. As it is, she figures she'd have to pay out $25,000 if her entire staff decides to use all their paid time off during a hiatus. Vendors for weddings and corporate events In the wedding industry, the going assumption among planners and vendors (e.g., event spaces, furniture rental companies, cake makers, videographers, musicians, florists, etc.) is that all weddings otherwise scheduled to take place in the next 60 days are going to be postponed, said Meghan Ely, vice president of the Wedding International Professionals Association. That timeline might have to change depending on how long social distancing is in force. But right now planners are trying to reschedule their clients' weddings for the fall. Vendors have already been paid their nonrefundable deposits, Ely said, but the anticipated revenue from the subsequent payments due will be delayed until closer to the weddings, whenever that takes place. Likewise, the corporate events industry has seen an overnight drop in business, said Carla Ruben, who runs the catering company Creative Edge Parties in New York City and Miami. Ruben says up to 70% of her revenue comes from corporations. And she estimates that within five business days she has lost $2.5 million as a result of cancellations in March and April. Now clients are canceling May events. Ruben normally employs 85 full-time staffers, but has had to lay off 55 of them. She also hires from a freelance roster of 450 cater waiters -- almost all of whom are actors and other artists. All of them, she said, are facing at least the next two months with no income. Her big hope now: Corporate clients will start planning ahead and putting down deposits for events they're most likely to have post-crisis, such as holiday parties in December.  When it comes to talk of stimulus and bailouts, Ruben said, ""caterers fall between the cracks. We're not hotels, restaurants or cruise ships. We're a $14 billion industry made up primarily of small businesses."" She's in better shape than many of her competitors, Ruben said, but she can't say yet how long she can sustain big revenue losses. Unless corporate clients start booking ahead for a post-pandemic world, ""I'm racing against the clock."" ",3/24/2020

Now her home state of California is under a ""stay at home"" order.  ""I don't have the money in the bank to pay the bills that are coming up,"" she said. As a single mother of a 1-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son, who, like her, is asthmatic and at a higher risk for complications from coronavirus, Hubbard is feeling fearful and overwhelmed. Rent will be due, the car insurance payment, the phone bill. ""I have credit card debt because I'm a single mom and that's what I have to do to survive,"" she said. ""But I've never been late on any of my payments. That's going to change.""   Efforts are being made to help Hubbard and the millions of people like her who are expected to lose income because of the pandemic.   Tax day has been pushed back until July 15. Some homeowners can defer their mortgage payments. Federal student loan payments have been delayed interest-free for two months. Some foreclosures and evictions have been suspended. Utility shutoffs in some municipalities have been put on hold. And the government is floating the idea of sending all Americans a check. But these measures won't stop all the pain.  What can you do if you know you are not going to be able to pay all your bills? Talk to your lenders now Getting relief is possible, but you need to talk with bill collectors now. ""Companies are going to be more receptive than ever before because they are under extreme regulatory pressure to work with you,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of federal consumer programs at the US Public Interest Research Groups. Regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have encouraged banks and financial institutions to work with customers to defer payments, make smaller payments or change the due date.  ""First try to work with your company,"" he said. ""Let them know you are having trouble making payments."" If you owe a payment to a bank or a financial firm and they don't work with you, complaining to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may help. They may contact your financial firm about your problem, said Mierzwinski. ""The complaint database works."" To get the federal student loan break, contact your servicer and ask about options. ""People should be aware there are a lot of different ways you can pay your student loan,"" said Mierzwinski. ""You may qualify for a better situation than the way you pay your loan now.""  Arrange for a break on housing payments Strong measures are being taken to allow people to follow ""stay at home"" orders, even when they can't make the payments. Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suspended foreclosures, ordered lenders to allow homeowners flexibility in payments, including offering them a break for up to a year, and suspended late charges and penalties.  As part of the package, they also put a stay on reporting late payments to credit bureaus by borrowers who are experiencing hardships. ""We are doing all we can to help those adversely impacted by the coronavirus, including by immediately suspending foreclosure sales and evictions during this challenging time,"" said Donna Corley, executive vice president and head of Freddie Mac's single-family business.  While Freddie and Fannie guarantee about half of US home loans, regulators hope the whole industry will adopt a similar policy. This relief is available immediately for borrowers who are unable to make their mortgage payments due to the coronavirus pandemic, regardless of whether they have contracted the virus. But you can't just stop paying. You need to contact your servicer -- the company you make mortgage payments to -- and work out a realistic plan going forward. Use the check from the government Dealing with a sudden loss of income when the government tells you to stay home is uncharted territory. ""The Covid-19 crisis is unlike any we've had in the modern interconnected economy because there are no categories for the impact,"" said Mierzwinski. ""Millions of people will be losing income or losing their jobs.""  More than half of the jobs in the economy are at high or moderate risk, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics. Since 40% of Americans could not cover a $400 unexpected expense prior to the pandemic, according to the Federal Reserve, this crisis will be felt almost immediately for the many people living paycheck to paycheck. Without a robust unemployment system that can provide support to gig workers, independent contractors, part-time employees and seasonal workers, there is not a good way to get cash in the hands of people except to write them checks, said Michael J. Graetz, a law professor at Columbia University and co-author of ""The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It."" The proposal to provide Americans a direct payment as a means of assistance is taking shape. The Senate is proposing ""recovery rebates"" of up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples earning below a certain income threshold. What people will do with the payment is up to them.  ""You're sending it to people who don't need it and you're sending it to people who may decide to go surfing instead of working,"" he said. ""But you can't make those distinctions if you want to get the money to the people who need it."" People like Hubbard face hard choices in prioritizing needs. For her, internet service is important since her son's school closed and his school work will now be done online from home. She puts a lower priority on her electric bill because PG&E, the utility, halted shutoffs to customers for nonpayment during California's state of emergency.  Still, ""there are some bills that will not be paid,"" she said.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/success/small-business-need-for-cash/index.html,Small business cash crunch grows 'more dire by the day',"Most small businesses typically have cash reserves of less than a month to buffer them against those days when they have less coming in than they have to pay out. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has effectively shut down large portions of local economies over the past several weeks, that month-long window (which is much shorter in some industries) is fast closing for many small businesses across the country. That's why the small business community and those that lend to them are desperate for a fast capital injection from the federal government to salvage things quickly. ""The demand for capital is unprecedented. Small businesses need cash to stay afloat to get to the other side. We're past the precipice,"" said Jared Hecht, CEO of Fundera, an online broker for small business loans. ""Every day matters. Every minute another small business closes."" And their lending options have narrowed considerably because lenders have no idea how to assess risk in this environment, he added. Lawmakers are still trying to finalize a stimulus package, which in the latest Senate Republican bill includes about $350 billion in Small Business Administration-approved loans that may be forgiven if certain conditions are met.  Ideally, Hecht said, that number should be tripled and given to small businesses without any expectation that it will be paid back. But it's not a perfect world. Small business groups, however, are advocating for a sizable amount of money to be paid out in grants on top of new loans.  ""[The loan provisions] are nice. They're better than nothing. But businesses are scared to death of getting more in debt,"" said John Arensmeyer, CEO of the Small Business Majority, which recommends at least $250 billion in grants on top of any loan provisions. ""A large majority are looking for a forgivable loan or a grant. If you have to take out a new line of credit and pay it back at 3.75% [which is the interest rate for an SBA disaster assistance loan] you won't see wide interest,"" said Kevin Kuhlman, senior director of federal government relations at the National Federation of Independent Businesses. ""Members are telling us they need immediate financial assistance that helps with liquidity and cash flow to survive the uncertain near future,"" said Kuhlman. ""The situation gets more dire every day."" Small business owners also want broad latitude in how the money -- whether through loans or grants -- may be spent, Arensmeyer said. While the push will be for them to use it to keep employees on payroll, that won't always be realistic for businesses that already were forced to shut down by their state, he said. They still have bills to pay, such as rent, utilities and other debt service. Arensmeyer's group is also calling on lawmakers to, among other things, extend special unemployment insurance to self-employed workers, and prevent small businesses from having to pay higher unemployment insurance premiums next year as a result of the pandemic.",3/25/2020

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/success/credit-card-debt-coronavirus/index.html,More people are avoiding cash. That might not be a good thing,"But relying heavily on credit cards could not come at a worse time for the millions who have lost income or suffered a job loss as a result of shutdowns. It's especially bad for those who may have already been in debt.  ""Household debt is at an all-time high,"" said Michael J. Graetz, a law professor at Columbia University and co-author of ""The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It. ""People have no savings to fall back on. They were maxed out on credit cards with extraordinarily high interest rates even before the coronavirus. It is very worrisome."" Household debt rose to $14 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a new record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The reliance on credit has already begun, according to a study from LendEDU. Nearly 70% of those who lost a job because of coronavirus are taking on more credit card debt than planned. Of those who have had their work hours cut, more than 60% are using credit more. Even 37% of those whose job remains unchanged are relying on cards more. Here's how to make the most of credit cards now and avoid getting in trouble down the line. Use the right card the best way  People turning to their credit cards more than usual need to keep an eye on their total spending in relation to income coming in, said Eric Powell, a chartered retirement planning counselor at RightPlan Financial in Lakeland, Florida. ""There is always the possibility of a decrease or total loss of income, now especially,"" said Powell. ""I like credit cards for the rewards that come with them, but being bored isn't an excuse to buy unnecessary items.""  Right now, use the card with the lowest interest rate.  ""If you have access to a zero-interest credit card, use it first,"" said JP Geisbauer, a certified financial planner with Centerpoint Financial Management in Newport Beach, California. ""If you don't, use the lowest interest credit card."" Keep your cost of borrowing as low as possible if you are regularly using credit, especially if you are worried about not being able to pay off the bill at the end of the month. That's more important than credit card rewards right now, Geisbauer said. There will also be a temptation to pull out money for the instances when you need cash.  ""Avoid taking cash advances,"" Geisbauer said. ""These are usually the highest rates.""  Request the help you need Regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are encouraging banks to work with people struggling with payments. Your credit card company may be willing to negotiate with you to reduce your payments, adjust your interest rate or defer payments temporarily. Top credit card issuers have responded with plans to support users, including Wells Fargo, Citi, Capital One, US Bank, Barclays, Chase, Discover, Bank of America and American Express. ""If your financial world has been turned upside down, the best time to call your credit card issuer and let them know is today,"" said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.  There has been a lot of talk about what the Federal Reserve has done by cutting rates and government relief efforts, but those take time. Some of the changes that an issuer can offer will help you today, said Schulz.  ""Reduced APRs that kick in quickly. Waived fees. Extended payment deadlines,"" he said. ""These can be very important in the short term, as you figure out how you will get to the end of this month, or the end of this week."" But be careful. The credit card company may opt to reduce your credit limit, said Howard Dvorkin, founder of Debt.com, a debt resolution resource site. But getting a lower interest rate might be worth the risk. ""I would advise that people drill down on their credit right now and see what opportunities you have to reduce your payment and reduce your interest,"" Dvorkin said. ""To reduce the interest is the ultimate thing."" Keep total debt from spiraling If you are already deep in credit card debt, Dvorkin said, a balance transfer credit card can help you pay off the debts, so long as you have a plan and get the payments done in the window of 0% interest. The best balance transfer credit card is the one that offers the lowest transfer fees with the longest 0% APR promotion period, Dvorkin said. But this balance transfer method only works if you pay off your debts as soon as possible, he said, since the rate will be much higher after the introductory period. If you've already lost your job or expect to, and think you might not have income for a while, doing a balance transfer now could put you at risk. The most important thing to do right now, said Dvorkin, is to avoid taking on too much debt. Only buy the essentials and keep your eye on your debt.  ""It's in your best interest to avoid panic buying and unnecessary expenses while this crisis lasts,"" said Dvorkin. ""Know that there is a solution to debt once this storm blows over, and, by not maxing out your credit cards now, you can put yourself in the best position possible."" ",3/25/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/perspectives/bailout-rage-coronavirus/index.html,We shouldn't be getting angry about big corporate bailouts,"People need to accept that bailouts are a necessary evil in a time of unprecedented economic chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But we're already seeing signs that Democrats and Republicans are unable to cooperate for the good of the American people. The White House and Congressional leaders are still bickering over the final details on a mainstream economic stimulus package. Yes, it's unfortunate that companies and CEOs that made bad, dumb and greedy decisions now need federal aid. But what's the alternative? Punish the rich at the expense of everyone else?  This argument came up in 2008, too. Some said we should let banks that took on too much risk tied to subprime mortgages fail.  Remember how that played out? The stock market, already reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, plummeted even further when Congress rejected the first attempt at a bank bailout plan. Some people quickly forget that big publicly traded companies employ tons of average American workers, who will also suffer if their parent companies aren't helped or saved.  Boeing (BA), for example, has 161,000 workers worldwide. Many of them are unionized blue-collar workers with pension plans -- not the C-suite executives with big salaries and stock bonuses who have made poor business decisions over the last several years.   Yes, conditions need to be attached to any federal aid packages. I wholeheartedly agree with calls to ensure that any company that receives a bailout should immediately suspend stock buyback plans and dividend payments and cancel any bonus payments for CEOs and other executives.  But the alternative to bailouts? Letting companies die? That's scarier. And selfish.  The Federal Reserve is pulling out all the stops to try and stop what will undoubtedly be a recession from becoming something even worse. It's time for Congress and the White House to step up, too. Elected officials and everyday Americans need to realize that now is not the time for finger wagging, raising the proverbial pitchforks and doling out punitive actions. We all need to get through this crisis first. And we need to do it together.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/economy/march-jobs-report-coronavirus/index.html,"The US economy lost 701,000 jobs in March — worst report since 2009","In March, the economy shed 701,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was the first time the economy lost jobs in a month since September 2010, and the worst month for American jobs since the depths of the Great Recession in March 2009. The unemployment rate shot up to 4.4%, from a near 50-year low of 3.5%. It was the highest unemployment rate since August 2017 and the largest single-month change in the jobless rate since January 1975. Most of the job destruction took place at restaurants and bars, where the economy lost 417,400 jobs. Retailers cut 46,200 jobs and health care employment fell by 43,000 jobs as routine visits at dentists and physicians offices fell.   If there's an ounce of good news in the March report, it's that bulk of the layoffs were temporary: 1.8 million people were unemployed temporarily last month, up from 1 million in February.  The jobs situation could get far worse But the labor market will probably start to look a whole lot worse starting next month. The numbers in the jobs report come from two surveys. A survey of 60,000 households and a survey of 145,000 businesses and government agencies. Those surveys are conducted during the week including the 12th day of the month, which in this case was the second week in March. Business closures and stay-at-home orders were only just beginning that week, and didn't really pick up steam until the week after.  The April jobs report, which won't be released until May 8, could include the nearly 10 million Americans who filed for first-time unemployment benefits as the outbreak forced businesses to close and people to stay home. While sectors like hospitality, tourism and entertainment were — unsurprisingly — first in facing layoffs, job losses over the next weeks will come from a wider range of sectors, said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at careers website Glassdoor. ""White collar jobs are not safe from this,"" Zhao said. In many states, people can file for unemployment benefits if they were furloughed or their hours were cut, so this doesn't necessarily mean all 10 million people lost their jobs completely. But claims for unemployment benefits, which are released every Thursday morning, are probably a better real-time indicator of pain in the labor market than the monthly jobs report. Normally, states decide who can file for unemployment benefits, but the government expanded these rules to include self-employed workers and independent contractors in the face of this unprecedented crisis. Many Americans will also receive one-off stimulus checks of as much as $1,200 over the next weeks, as the government is trying to soften the blow with its coronavirus stimulus package -- the CARES Act. Consumer spending is vital for the US economy, and with so many people out of work, economists are worrying about the aftermath of the virus outbreak. The US unemployment rate could soar significantly higher, too. In the Labor Department's monthly jobs report, people can be characterized as ""unemployed"" as long they are available to work, looked for a job in the last four weeks and didn't find one. That's regardless of whether they filed for benefits or not. How bad could it get? One of the worst predictions comes from the St. Louis Fed, which has predicted unemployment could rise above 30% for example. If that happens, that will be higher than in the Great Depression. The unemployment rate peaked at 24.9% in 1933, according to historical estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Stifel chief economist Lindsey Piegza is also forecasting peak unemployment of about 30%, saying in a report Friday that ""as we continue to keep the economy closed, more than 45 million Americans are expected to lose their jobs."" The highest the unemployment rate went in the Great Recession was 10% in October 2009. The Congressional Budget Office expects the unemployment rate to climb past 10% in the second quarter, it said Thursday. Financial markets have been leading economic data in reacting to the coronavirus crisis. US stocks sold off sharply in March, with the S&P 500 (SPX) recording its worst month since 2008. Stocks opened lower Friday following the jobs report. ""Markets have already priced in a lot and April will be another horrible month,"" said Nela Richardson, principal and investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""But what will happen after April? There will be a phasing in period as people return to work and the market can't predict that."" -- CNN's Christine Romans and Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.",4/4/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/success/small-businesses-how-they-cope/index.html,5 creative ways small businesses are trying to stay afloat,"But as owners assess the damage, some are also figuring out ways to bring in some cash, serve their communities and try to stay viable until the economy recovers. Party in a Box A caterer's livelihood traditionally depends on now-forbidden large gatherings. So Jeffrey Selden, managing partner of Marcia Selden Catering & Events in Connecticut, decided to get creative. Last Friday, he came up with the idea to sell two home delivery options for clients.  ""People still need to eat. And we're used to bringing food to the table,"" said Selden, who is also president of the International Caterers Association. He is now selling a Party in a Box, delivered free to clients' homes. The basic box includes beer, vodka, a specialty cocktail, juice, tonic, club soda and hors d'oeuvres. An upgraded version called Stir Crazy, includes all of that plus bottles of tequila, bourbon, scotch and Prosecco, as well as desserts.  In addition, Selden's company is also producing prepackaged meals that can be frozen (mostly comfort foods, he said) and it delivers to customers' homes.  A gift card that 'buys time' Frank Zona, who owns three hair salons in the Boston area, has created a new gift card called the Curve Initiative. Any card purchased in March will increase in value every month from April to July. Under the promotion, a $100 gift card will be worth $146 by July. If it is not used by July 31, it will revert to its original $100 value. ""We're doing a 'buying time' promotion. It creates some revenue for us and gives people a sense of security that we'll still be there,"" Zona said.  He believes that businesses live by the permission of communities, and that the community wants to invest in Main Street's recovery once the US succeeds in slowing the spread of coronavirus. From fine dining to bagels Few people would look at an award-winning, upscale restaurant and think, ""This place should sell bagels for breakfast!"" Yet that's exactly what the owners of the 70-year-old, Seattle restaurant Canlis decided to do after temporarily shutting down its dining room a few weeks ago. Co-owners and brothers, Mark and Brian Canlis, also chose to create a burger drive-thru for lunch and to prepare prepackaged meals to be delivered to people's stoops with a bottle of wine for dinner. The move has meant all 115 employees got to keep their jobs. And it provides the funding for the restaurant to provide free food to health care workers offering critical care to patients with COVID-19. ""We've just been delivering a bunch of burgers and a whole bunch of smiles and we tell them, 'You guys got this.' They're working nonstop. [The 'Drive on Thru'] is a fun way to say come buy a burger and we'll give one to those who don't have the luxury of staying home. There are so many heroes out there,"" Mark Canlis said. Canlis is also launching a fourth venture, selling community supported agriculture (CSA) boxes at cost to customers, which will include fresh meat, eggs and produce. The idea is to support local farmers -- who now can't sell to restaurants or at farmers' markets because both were closed by the state. The idea behind all four ventures is not to turn a profit. In fact, they're taking a loss on the bagel operation.   ""The idea is to encourage the city, safely stay employed and keep our farmers' food flowing into this town,"" Canlis said. ""And to get people out of their house. We may feel isolated but we're not alone."" Breaking rules Normally owners of franchises have to stick pretty closely to the parent company's playbook on branding and special offers.  ""Now franchisees are going to gain a little more flexibility. The rules are thrown out the window,"" said Nick Powills, publisher of the franchise news magazine 1851. ""In essence, it's do whatever you can to protect your dollars."" Some food franchise owners, for instance, are trying to create party packages to, say, entice a customer who before would only buy one item to instead buy 10 at once, Powills said. Customers need to see more value, he added, especially since they now may be squeezed economically. At the same time, they're trying to stock their freezers as they spend more time at home.  At Wing Zone, for instance, the new discounting efforts are going toward larger quantity orders. ""They're taking the Super Bowl deals and applying them to today's world,"" Powills said.  For franchise owners, who see their profits potentially plummeting, ""The new winning is [breaking] even or at least not bleeding your life savings,"" Powills said.  And being able to stay in the game long enough to recover. Helping parents keep their kids busy Kate Fryer's shop -- A Bead Just So -- in Ballston Spa, New York, is a micro business. The only two employees are Fryer and someone who helps her out on Saturdays.  ""My shop is like a bar,"" she said. Fryer knows all her customers by name and they always come in to talk about what's going on in their lives.  Except recently, when almost no one has come by. Her shop sells beads, offers bead weaving classes and throws craft-based birthday parties. ""I'm in a panic at the moment,"" said Fryer, who has a toddler at home. She's now starting to use her Facebook and Instagram pages (@abeadjustso) to sell online. And she is offering curbside pickup and shipping -- because many of her clients are staying home. But even more relevant for these strange days, Fryer is now offering what she informally calls a ""quarantine"" beading kit for parents looking for new ways to keep their kids from getting bored. The Memory Wire Beading Kit, which costs $22, includes enough beads and materials to make two necklaces and two bracelets.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/tech/china-startup-funding-coronavirus/index.html,Chinese startups were already struggling to raise money. The coronavirus may be the last straw,"So far this year, venture capital investment in startups throughout Greater China — which includes the mainland and Hong Kong — has plummeted more than 65% compared to the same period a year ago, according to data provider PitchBook.  That's bad news for many companies, which were already struggling to find funding during what came to be known last year as a ""capital winter."" Firms in the region raised a collective $54 billion in venture capital in 2019, about half of what they raised in 2018. ""Covid-19 has been another challenge among a series of setbacks for China's venture capital landscape,"" said Alex Frederick, a venture capital analyst at PitchBook.  A bad situation made worse Startups are important to China's long-term economic ambitions. The country has leapfrogged the United States to become the world's biggest hub for unicorns, or billion-dollar private companies. Venture capitalists are paying particular attention to technology firms, which could help bolster Beijing's goal to become a global leader in artificial intelligence, electric cars and other areas. But many Chinese startups struggled to court investors last year. Economic activity in China slowed as the country contended with cooling domestic demand and a trade war with the United States.  Troubles at high-profile startups, meanwhile, have become cautionary tales for many investors. US office space provider WeWork's initial public offering, for example, was notoriously shelved last year, while Chinese electric automaker Nio (NIO) has seen its stock crater 44% from a year ago to less than $3 a share as the company bleeds money. The coronavirus could now deliver a fatal blow to companies not strong enough to weather the economic turmoil. Frederick said there is no perfect comparison to what startups are facing now, but he noted that the environment is similar to what companies faced during the Great Recession more than a decade ago.  ""During the last recession, startups funded during the crises underwent longer periods between financings, and valuation step-ups declined considerably,"" the analyst added. ""Efforts to contain the coronavirus have led to an economic slowdown, and uncertainty around the severity and length of the slowdown is likely further exacerbating economic volatility."" Spooked investors Gloom caused by the sudden economic shock has been palpable among entrepreneurs and investors, while fallout from the coronavirus pandemic feels inescapable, according to interviews CNN Business conducted with more than half a dozen people that are active in growing new companies. The uninterrupted period between the Lunar New Year holiday and summer break is usually the time of year that startups use to lock down deals, said Oscar Ramos, managing director of Chinaccelerator, a startup incubator based in Shanghai.  Not this year. Instead, entrepreneurs are prioritizing more pressing matters: Cut costs. Draft a contingency plan. Reconsider expensive growth ambitions.  Before the outbreak, Hong Kong-based fintech startup MioTech had been working to expand in Singapore, said CEO Jason Tu. Now, it's putting those arrangements on hold. Tu told CNN Business that his team was ""trying to save every penny"" as its peers in the startup community battled to survive. ""I have quite a good number of startup friends who are about to close their doors,"" he said. ""Anything that relies heavily on supply chain, delivery or offline presence, are all busting right now."" Even companies that have managed to snag large amounts of capital in recent months are reassessing their priorities. Xpeng Motors, an electric automaker backed by Alibaba (BABA), raised $400 million last November, claiming one of the biggest funding rounds in China that quarter, according to PitchBook.  The company was looking at ways to tighten expenses before the outbreak, said Brian Gu, president of the Guangzhou-based startup. But the health crisis is forcing it to dig even deeper, he said, adding that Xpeng Motors is looking at which plans it can put on the back burner. It is also considering other ways to obtain capital, such as taking out bank loans or pursuing government subsidies.  Plans to meet in person with prospective investors have also been thrown out the window because of travel restrictions and city or nationwide lockdowns.  ""Of course it is slower, because I can't meet anyone,"" said Edith Yeung, managing partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Proof of Capital and an adviser at incubator 500 Startups. She typically spends about half the year in China, and has not been able to return to the country since the outbreak started.  Abel Zhao, CEO and co-founder of Hong Kong-based AI software firm TravelFlan, said he's also experiencing complications while trying to obtain funding. His company — which deals with customer service for airlines, hotels and other vendors — is in talks to raise $12 million from venture capitalists in Beijing, but has been finding it tough to seal the deal. ""Two of the investors from China are basically saying, 'You need to fly to Beijing to meet us before we can actually issue you the term sheet,'"" Zhao said. ""So I'm thinking, you know, should I just go and then just stay there until everything is over?"" The new normal Some companies have found workarounds, preventing activity from grinding to a complete halt. Chinaccelerator's Ramos, whose firm also runs a venture fund that focuses on early-stage startups, said his team had wrapped up more than 10 investments since the beginning of the virus outbreak, totaling about $2.1 million. He said several transactions were already in the works prior to the outbreak, while other deals were the result of personal referrals.  Entrepreneurs have also been pitching investors through video conferencing platform Zoom (ZM), with some even having virtual ""happy hour"" meetings to grab a beer and talk shop, Ramos added. Zhao said he has taken to calling investors on Zoom weekly, trying to maintain face-to-face contact. ""I need to make sure their interest remains high,"" he explained. But there's a limit to how much can be done online when millions of dollars are at stake. ""You can't build a relationship without seeing each other,"" said Yeung, the venture firm partner in Silicon Valley. ""No matter how many Zoom calls you do. It's just not the same.""   The due diligence process — what shareholders generally call the final vetting of a company's background before closing a deal — is typically done in person. But that is hard to do now, said Yeung, because that stage often includes visiting companies in person to assess the management culture and review financial statements. Ramos acknowledged the difficulty in closing deals, but said his firm had been able to work around it so far. ""Travel restrictions [and] office access restrictions are limiting due diligence,"" he noted. ""But that doesn't mean investments are not happening."" And things are expected to bounce back: Experts, including Frederick, the PitchBook analyst, anticipate a revival when the outbreak ends, predicting that investors will simply hold onto their capital and resume as normal as conditions improve. Survival of the fittest Even if there is an eventual rebound, entrepreneurs will likely have to endure significant hardship before that happens. Frederick noted that venture capitalists during the Great Recession more heavily scrutinized the financials of startups before taking the plunge to invest. ""Unprofitable startups reliant on VC funding fared the worst as funding dried up for those with high burn rates and unclear paths to profitability,"" he said. ""Those startups that were already profitable or those with low burn rates and clear paths to profitability fared best."" Others said the outbreak is testing how strong the leadership is at many startups.  ""If they didn't prepare even for at least three to six months more of cash flow, and they have to raise now because they're running out of cash, I really should not invest to begin with,"" said Yeung, the Silicon Valley venture firm partner. For companies like TravelFlan, the 2019 crisis was a wake-up call. Zhao acknowledged that he and his co-founder were forced to forgo salaries for more than a year, while other staffers went without pay for several months.  In light of those problems, he said, TravelFlan decided to rethink its entire business model by expanding its scope beyond travel to include other lifestyle service providers, and taking on major partners from other sectors, including Samsung and China Mobile. Eventually, it was able to secure an investment from several venture firms, raising $7 million at a valuation of $27 million.  Zhao said that experience has put the team in a better position to weather the uncertainty now. ""If I did not go through all that, I'd probably still be operating the company the same way,"" he added. ""So all of these things happened to force myself, force my partner to look into the company rather than look outside at what investors wanted."" Silicon Valley investment firm Sequoia Capital summed up the situation more starkly in an open letter to founders this month. ""In some ways, business mirrors biology,"" the company wrote. ""As Darwin surmised, those who survive 'are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the most adaptable to change.'""",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/success/small-business-economic-stimulus/index.html,How small business owners may benefit from the $2 trillion federal aid package,"Overall, small business groups are pleased some assistance is coming. But they also stress the package -- which includes close to $400 billion in aid for small business owners -- is still not enough to save Main Street.  ""This doesn't cure the crisis. It's a good start. But more support will be needed,"" said Derek Peebles, executive director of the American Independent Business Alliance (AMIBA). The provisions are also unlikely to save those small businesses that will have to come up with cash to stay afloat until they can actually get the government's aid money in hand. ""There's no way many can keep going,"" said John Arensmeyer, CEO of Small Business Majority, a national small business advocacy group. Speed will be key to helping any small business survive, especially when it comes to dispensing the forgivable loans that will be available to owners who keep paying their employees during the crisis.  ""We anticipate small businesses will rush to apply for these loans. The government must make sure lenders are ready and able to deploy the cash,"" Frank Knapp, Jr., president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Here's a breakdown of the major provisions small businesses included in Congress' aid package:  An emergency grant of up to $10,000: Small businesses may apply directly to the federal Small Business Administration to receive an economic injury disaster grant of up to $10,000 that does not need to be paid back. The money would be paid out to business owners within three days of their application's submission. It can be used to maintain payroll, cover paid sick leave and service other debt obligations.  Short-term forgiveness on new loans of up to $10 million: The bill allots $350 billion for special SBA loans that may be partially forgiven if certain conditions are met.  ""Think of this as a grant that can be part of a bigger loan,"" Jaret Seiberg, managing director of financial services at the Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in his analysis.  SBA lenders will be authorized to make loans equal to 250% of an employer's average monthly payroll up to $10 million. Under that loan, eight weeks' worth of payroll obligations (including wages and benefits), plus rent or mortgage payments and utilities will be forgiven, and the amount forgiven would not be treated as taxable income to the small business owner.   The new loans will be available through 800 SBA-approved banks, credit unions and other lenders. But the bill also calls on the SBA and Treasury to increase the number of lenders offering the new loans. And it calls on the agencies to expedite the loan process. Lastly, owners who also take the $10,000 grant described above will see the amount of their loan forgiveness reduced by $10,000. Provides a hiatus on paying existing SBA loans: Business owners that already have an existing SBA loan will not have to pay interest or principal on it for six months.  The bill allots $17 billion for the SBA to cover those payments instead. A payroll tax credit to help retain employees: Businesses that have experienced a 50% drop in gross receipts relative to the same quarter last year may qualify for a payroll tax credit worth up to $10,000 per employee so long as they are still paying their employees wages and/or health benefits. Even businesses that have furloughed employees due to forced closures under state and local mandates may claim the credit as long as they are still paying their workers wages or health benefits on furlough. The credit would reduce the small business' payroll tax liability and the employer may get an advance on that credit from the IRS.  The credit would also be refundable, meaning it would still be paid in full even if it exceeds the business owner's payroll tax liability. But there is one caveat: small businesses that opt to claim this credit will not be allowed to apply for the new SBA forgivable loans. Other individual provisions: Small business owners, particularly self-employed independent contractors, may qualify for one or more of the provisions in the bill designed to help workers through direct cash payments and temporarily enhanced unemployment benefits.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/boeing-bailout-government-stake/index.html,Boeing will seek federal help -- but won't give taxpayers a stake,"Although the federal government likely will end up owning stakes in the nation's airlines, taxpayers probably won't receive shares of Boeing (BA). The aircraft maker asked for help from the federal government on March 17, as the airlines,  hotels, restaurants, retailers and other industries were simultaneously requesting assistance. And there is potential help for Boeing in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill that just passed Congress. Although some of those other companies, such as airlines, will likely get direct government grants to weather the crisis, Boeing said it was looking primarily for loan guarantees, which can lower the cost of borrowing and make it easier to find loans. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was asked earlier this week about how he felt about the prospect of the government taking a stake in his company in return for help, he said he was not in favor of such a move.  In an interview on Fox Business, he said that if the government required an equity in exchange for help, that Boeing would ""look at all the other options, and we've got plenty of them.""  ""If they attach too many things to it [government assistance], of course you take a different course."" That comment prompted Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to suggest Friday that Boeing would not be getting any help from the government. ""I can only comment on what Boeing has said publicly, which is Boeing has said they have no intention of using the programs. That may change in the future,"" he said in an interview that was also on Fox Business. Boeing confirmed after Mnichin's comment that nothing had changed and that it would seek federal help. The bailout programs requiring an equity stake include the $25 billion in grants for airlines and a separate pool of $17 billion that would be available for companies like Boeing that are deemed to be ""critical to maintaining national security."" But the aircraft maker doesn't intend to ask for direct aid, only for the loan guarantees. ""We need to know the credit markets are open, not just for us but for the entire supply chain,"" he said in a interview on CNBC. So far the credit markets have been open to Boeing. It still has an investment-grade credit rating, despite recent downgrades. And it was able to borrow $13.8 billion from a syndicate of major banks in February, before the coronavirus crisis sparked a crisis in the global airline industry but well after the problems and costs of the 737 Max crisis were apparent. It also announced it would suspend the dividend that it has paid continually since 1942. Last year the dividend cost Boeing $4.6 billion. And while it spent billions repurchasing its shares in recent years, the company stopped those share repurchases last April to conserve cash after the 737 Max was grounded and deliveries of the plane stopped. It doesn't expect to repurchase any shares for at least several years until it pays down the debt it has run up because of the Max. The government did take stakes in major banks and in General Motors (GM) during the bailouts of 2008 and 2009. But that was because it was injecting capital straight into those companies. The Treasury sold most of their stakes in those companies long ago, although it still controls a majority of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/tech/ibm-artificial-intelligence-language/index.html,IBM wants to make computers fluent in human,"Artificial intelligence systems have taken on a growing role in business as their abilities to process and learn from large quantities of data have improved. But they have struggled to understand the kinds of nuances that appear in everyday communication among people. IBM (IBM) is adding new tools to its AI system, Watson, which can address that problem and better understand human language. The ""natural language processing"" technology was developed for IBM Research's Project Debater, the AI machine that became the first to compete against a world class human debater last year.  To hold its own in a debate, Project Debater needed to have the ability to listen to its opponent, understand his or her argument and formulate a response rapidly, all without internet access. That meant the computer needed to be able to identify and make sense of colloquialisms and idioms — as well as certain dialects or industry-specific terms — such as ""open a can of worms"" or ""hardly helpful"" (previously, an AI system might think someone was actually opening a can of worms).  Companies will now be able to use IBM's natural language processing tools to more efficiently and effectively comb through documents and conduct research, field incoming communications and improve customer service.  ""Everything that happens in a business is based on communication between employees, business partners, customers, and communication takes the form of emails, chats, text, documents,"" Rob Thomas, general manager of IBM Data and AI, told CNN Business. ""Some of the best data a company has is codified in all that language, all those communications."" Around 48% of global chief investment officers will be looking to deploy AI systems in their companies this year, according to a 2019 survey by research firm Gartner. A January IBM survey of 4,500 ""technology decision makers"" within companies around the world similarly found that 45% of companies with more than 1,000 employees have adopted AI.  One major improvement over existing AI systems is the system's ability to do ""sentiment analysis"" — to look at what someone is saying or has written and understand what they are really trying to communicate and what the context is. For example, it could now comprehend that someone saying they have ""cold feet"" means that they're apprehensive, not that their limbs are chilly.  ""A lot of how we talk and interact, certainly in customer support, is using a lot of idioms or terms that are specific to an industry,"" Thomas said.  When that capability is plugged into an existing IBM AI tool called Watson Discovery, it can also make it easier for companies to dig through and glean insights from troves of documents and other written communications.  The system is better able to understand the central themes or important points in documents and classify them into more specific categories, so they're more useful. It can also generate succinct summaries from mass amounts of data. The tool can also tell when two documents are making essentially the same point with different words. ""If Watson is going through a million documents, it can identify: What's the information that's most relevant given the problem that's trying to be solved?"" Thomas said.  This could come in handy, for instance, when a company is fielding customer service requests and needs to direct them to different places so they can be properly handled. It could also be used by a law firm to sort through documents and come to conclusions about them for discovery in a legal case — what would normally take a lawyer days or weeks, would take the machine a matter of minutes.  One of the major concerns about the field of artificial intelligence is that in some cases, such systems have been found to exhibit bias against certain groups of people, including people of color.  Thomas stressed that trust is essential for businesses that use AI, as well as their customers. He said IBM has a tool called Watson OpenScale that, among other capabilities, can do bias detection and mitigation of companies' AI tools.  ""Trust is essential — being able to use AI that you can explain, that's free from bias, that's trusted,"" Thomas said.  And while artificial intelligence systems may change the way people work, they're unlikely to negate the need for human workers. Instead, Thomas said, the tools could make people more effective at their jobs.  ""Maybe the problem is too hard for the AI to solve, but if you pair this tech with (a human worker), their ability and speed to find the solution goes up rapidly,"" he said. ",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/success/employees-who-cant-work-from-home/index.html,Stuck at home but can't do your job remotely? Here's what to expect,"Think of anyone who works in customer-facing roles (e.g., in retail, hospitality, travel, or even bank branches that close). Or anyone who works with their hands, such as manufacturing plant workers, massage therapists, housekeepers or home health care aides. Or anyone who can't do their job when business comes to a standstill, like sales agents. How many employers are able to continue paying those idled employees -- and for how long -- is fast-changing.  As things unfolded in early March, a survey of 805 mostly mid- to large-sized employers by consulting firm Willis Towers Watson found a majority said they were still going to pay their idled hourly employees who couldn't work from home. But most -- especially retailers -- only promised to do so for 10 to 15 days at 100% of their workers' current base rate.   ""This week, the question is, 'Now what?'"" said Adrienne Altman, a Willis Towers Watson's managing director. One well known company has already answered: Macy's announced on Monday it would now furlough most of its employees, keeping on just a skeleton crew. Other employers are likely to announce their own decisions soon. Given the uncertainty about how long stay-at-home orders will be in place and how long the economy is going to be a mess, employers are having to make hard calls on the fly. Many are trying to figure out if they can afford to keep their idled workers on payroll -- even at partial pay. Or if they should furlough them with an implicit promise to bring them back when things improve. Or if they should lay them off altogether.  Furloughing can have benefits implications, said Mark Neuberger, at attorney in Foley & Lardner's labor practice. Depending on how a company's health plan is written, he said, the employer may continue subsidizing furloughed workers' health insurance premiums, whereas that might not be allowed for laid-off workers. Employers also are factoring into their decisions the new $2 trillion federal economic aid package that was signed into law last Friday. Several measures in the package seek to support workers and their employers as the country fights the pandemic. For example, one measure offers any worker laid off because of the coronavirus an additional $600 per week on top of their state unemployment benefit for four months. So a company that wants to temporarily cut costs might consider whether an employee wouldn't be better off on unemployment in the short-run.  For instance, in Florida, the average weekly unemployment benefit is $275. Under the new aid package that becomes $875 per week, which is better than the $600 a week that a worker making $15 an hour is paid. ""If you're a low wage worker you could be doing a lot better,"" said Chris O'Leary, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. In instances where an employer has the means to continue paying its idled workers but at a reduced rate -- say, only half of what they normally are paid while working -- the employee still may apply for partial unemployment benefits to cover some of their lost income, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/tech/nuro-self-driving-vehicle-houston-dot/index.html,US clears the way for this self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals,"Nuro, based in Mountain View, California, is now able to launch up to 5,000 of its R2 autonomous vehicles over the next two years, according to the US Department of Transportation. The R2 has no steering wheel, pedals or side mirrors as it's designed to be unmanned and carry cargo. Large compartments on its side open up to reveal deliveries, such as groceries or pizza. Nuro said it will initially deploy the R2 in six zip codes in Houston, covering 160,000 residents. It plans to start delivering Domino's pizza in Houston soon, although it didn't specify an exact date. In December, the company announced a partnership with Walmart to test autonomous grocery delivery in Houston sometime this year. The federal government has told self-driving companies to apply for exemptions to its vehicle standards in order to more quickly get innovative technologies onto roadways. Nuro is the first company to receive an exemption from the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which requires cars to have a long list of safety features including airbags and seat belts. ""Since this is a low-speed self-driving delivery vehicle, certain features that the department traditionally required -- such as mirrors and windshield for vehicles carrying drivers -- no longer make sense,"" said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in a statement. The R2 is also classified as a low-speed vehicle so it doesn't have to meet the same safety requirements as cars and SUVs. Low-speed vehicles can only go as fast as 25 miles per hour and must not weigh more than 2,500 pounds. Nuro is required to report any crash-related information to the federal government and to periodically report general information about the R2's operation. A spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation declined to offer additional details on what other data must be provided. ""One will need to look at the fine print of the reporting requirements to fully assess if NHTSA will be requiring robust enough information on adverse events to fully quantify the risks and benefits of the deployments,"" said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center at MIT. ""I'm glad to see that this is only for low speed deployments as one needs to walk before anyone is allowed to run."" Initially, the R2 will be followed by a vehicle with a human driver who will monitor it and intervene remotely if needed. The R2 is already being tested on private land. Nuro plans to build only a few hundred R2s in its first year and will remain focused on Houston for the time being. It expects to produce thousands more vehicles once it releases its next-generation R3. The company did not say when it plans to release the R3.  Unlike most self-driving companies, Nuro is focused on carrying goods rather than people. There are fewer safety and ethical questions when an autonomous vehicle is carrying groceries than a human being. Such questions as to whether a pedestrian or a passenger should be prioritized in a crash can be avoided. Most self-driving companies have not applied for government exemptions as they continue to develop and alter their vehicles. Companies offering self-driving rides today, such as Alphabet's Waymo, are relying on vehicles that include traditional car components, including steering wheel, pedals and mirrors, which have given them a quicker path to deployment.",3/21/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/business/airlines-payroll-cuts-coronavirus/index.html,United Airlines poised to slash payroll costs without quick bailout,"United Airlines says it could be forced to cut payroll costs by as much as 60% if an airline industry bailout isn't approved by Congress by the end of the month. And Delta Air Lines now expects revenue to plunge 80% in the three months period that begins in April, according to a company filing. A letter sent to United' (UAL)s nearly 100,000 employees by CEO Oscar Munoz, President Scott Kirby and many of the airline's union leaders warns that the drop in travel demand because of the coronavirus outbreak will force it to cut its April schedule by 60% ""If Congress doesn't act on sufficient government support by the end of March, our company will begin to take the necessary steps to reduce our payroll in line with the 60% schedule reduction we announced for April. May's schedule is likely to be cut even further."" The reduced cost could come through employee furloughs, pay cuts or a combination of the two. United, the nation's second largest airline behind American (AAL), spent $12 billion on payroll and benefits in 2019. It announced on Sunday that it was cutting its schedule for April and May by 50%.  Its revised reduction of 60% to its April schedule is due to additional travel restrictions and steps to battle the virus outbreak. Yet even at that reduced rate of flying, United expects to fill only 20% to 30% of seats. That is far below the 84% of seats that it sold throughout last year, and less than half the roughly 65% of seats that an airline needs to sell to just break even. Air travel has been hurt not just by strict restrictions on international travelers flying to the United States, but also by warnings from health professionals for Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 people, to stay close to home and to eliminate non-essential travel. Several states, including California, New York and Illinois, have announced orders telling citizens to stay home unless they are shopping for food or medicine, seeking medical attention or performing a job deemed to be essential. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian also wrote to his airline's employees Friday, revealing that the airline now expects that revenue there will plunge $10 billion, an 80% decline, in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago.  ""It's also clear, given the underlying damage the virus has created to the overall economy, that demand recovery will take an extended period once the virus is contained,"" he said. Delta arranged for $2.6 billion in new borrowing and drew down an additional $3 billion in cash on an existing credit line, Bastian revealed. And he said about 13,000 of Delta's more than 90,000  employees have agreed to take voluntary unpaid leaves. He also defended past spending by the company, saying that most of the profits in recent years went into new aircraft and employees, not to share repurchases or dividends that benefit shareholders. Earlier this week Bastian wrote another letter to employees in which he said the airline would cut 70% of it scheduled flights and  park 600 of its jets, more than half of its fleet. He also warned that involuntary furloughs or pay cuts might be necessary. ""I know everyone is concerned about the security of your jobs and pay. Given the uncertainty about the duration of this crisis, we are not yet at a point to make any decisions,"" he wrote on Wednesday. ""And those are very painful decisions to even consider. In this unpredictable environment we can't take any options off the table, but any steps that would affect your jobs or pay rates would be the absolute last thing we would do, and only if necessary to secure Delta's long-term future."" Labor leaders throughout the airline industry have joined with management in an effort to win quick approval of a $50 billion bailout of the nation's passenger airlines and an additional $8 billion for the nation's air cargo carriers. Management and union leadership at American Airlines sent a similar joint letter to Congressional leaders on Friday morning. While there is significant bipartisan support in Congress for a bailout, the first version of the bill announced by Senate Republicans had all the aid going to airlines in the form of loan guarantees rather than half loans and half grants, as requested by the airlines. United's letter did not say whether it would need that mix of grants and loans, or if it could avoid payroll cost cuts if it got only loans rather than the requested $25 billion in grants.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/tech/spacex-starship-starhopper-test-flight/index.html,SpaceX's massive Starship prototype lifts off ,"It was the first time the experimental craft, nicknamed ""Starhopper,"" flew free without being tethered to the ground. SpaceX's goal was to lift the spacecraft about 65 feet into the air before gently landing it nearby — what's SpaceX called a ""hop test."" It's not clear exactly how high the craft flew. Footage captured by reporters present at the South Texas launch site show fire and smoke erupting from Starhopper's massive Raptor rocket engine, obscuring the vehicle from view.  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said the flight was a success. ""Water towers *can* fly,"" he joked in a tweet, referencing Starhopper's likeness to a cylindrical water tank. He also shared views of the launch that were captured by a nearby drone and a camera near the Raptor engine. Musk tweeted that SpaceX will next attempt a 200 meter, or 650 foot, hop test ""in a week or two."" Starhopper's successful run came one day after a hop attempt was aborted three seconds after the Raptor engine fired up. The craft never left the ground, and stray flames appeared to shoot out from the top of the vehicle, but no serious damage was done. Musk said the hop test was called off because the fuel was ""colder than expected,"" causing an issue with pressure levels inside the vehicle. Starhopper is designed to be an early precursor to a deep-space exploration rocket called Starship, and Musk has said rapid development of the technology is a top priority for SpaceX. The latest design for Starship, which was earlier referred to as BFR, show it riding into orbit atop the most powerful rocket booster ever built. SpaceX hopes to use the launch system to deliver massive loads of satellites into orbit, and eventually to shuttle humans out into the solar system to explore and colonize Mars. Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire who landed a deal with SpaceX to one day use a Starship spacecraft to circle the moon, tweeted praised to Musk. ""Congrats!!! Moon is right there!"" he wrote.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/business/mcdonalds-marion-gross-risk-takers/index.html,"It took three years, but here's how she got 14,000 McDonald's stores to switch to fresh beef","That's because in spring 2018, McDonald's swapped out frozen beef for fresh beef in most of its quarter-pound burgers in the United States — and the improved product has been a hit.  Sales of the burger have soared since the change. In the first three months of 2019, McDonald's sold 40 million more quarter-pound burgers in the United States than it did in the same period the year before, when it was still mostly using frozen beef. McDonald's reported in June 2019 that the change also helped its burgers gain US market share in what the industry calls the ""informal eating out"" category for the first time in five years. It may seem like a simple, obvious decision: Fresh beef gets hotter faster and tastes juicier, delivering a more appetizing burger. Through consumer insights, McDonald's knew that their customers would respond well to the upgrade. And the improved burgers could help McDonald's better compete with its rivals. So-called ""better burger"" chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack have gained traction, raising the bar for mainstream outlets. And the success of fast casual joints like Chipotle and Panera has pushed larger chains to switch to fresher ingredients.  But it took about three years to make the change, and Marion Gross, chief supply chain officer for McDonald's in North America, initially balked at the idea.  ""I think I said, 'Not while I'm in this job,'"" Gross told CNN Business's Rachel Crane. She was particularly concerned that introducing a new ingredient — which has to be handled in a new way — into McDonald's complex supply chain could also accidentally introduce new risks to food safety in restaurant kitchens. She was skeptical because ""of the enormity of the change that had to be made.""  Gross is responsible for nearly $14 billion in food, equipment and packaging and oversees more than 15,000 restaurants in North America, including roughly 14,000 locations in the United States. The company's supply chain is the mechanism that enables those restaurants to sling burgers, fries and beverages to millions of people every day. It's a carefully calibrated system that includes suppliers, distributors, franchise operators and other stakeholders. Even small changes require a great deal of planning and consideration — and convincing everyone involved that it's worth making the change. Any tweak to the system increases the likelihood of something going wrong.  Gross, who stepped into the role in 2013, said that a former chair of the McDonald's board once called the company's supply chain a ""daily miracle.""  Related: See the 20 Risk Takers pushing global business forward What he meant, Gross said, is that nobody notices when the supply chain is working properly. But they notice when it breaks down. ""The only time that supply chain even sort of hits anybody's radar is when something goes wrong,"" she said.  Making a change to one of McDonald's signature menu items is particularly risky — especially if that change could introduce food safety concerns.  From dream to reality  By mid-2015, McDonald's was in a rough spot. Visits to restaurants were down, and same-store sales — which measure the sales at locations open around a year — had been down for two years running. The company decided to close 350 underperforming restaurants globally, which was a rare contraction.  ""Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot, fresh food,"" said then CEO Steve Easterbrook during a July 2015 call with analysts.   So the company's leadership set to work on turning the business around. Those efforts included tapping people across the company for ideas on how to make better food.  That year, McDonald's franchise operator Joe Jasper met with chefs, suppliers and McDonald's corporate employees from its business insights and menu marketing teams, among others. That ""food journey"" team, about 20 people altogether, was tasked with figuring out a way to make McDonald's burgers the best among all quick-service restaurants.  During its first brainstorming session, the group came up with the idea for a hotter, juicier burger, Jasper said. But they didn't land on fresh beef right away.  When Jasper, who at the time owned and operated 20 McDonald's locations in Texas, returned to his team, he brainstormed with them, as well. They agreed that if possible, fresh beef in a Quarter Pounder ""would be amazing.""  So he set to work. Along with two others, Jasper spent three days in one of his kitchens, working about eight to ten hours each day. The goal was to cook up a hot, juicy burger without making major changes to the kitchen's operating system and without slowing down the drive thru. With those parameters in mind, Jasper and his team had to deliberate over every detail — from the width and thickness of the patty to the amount of pressure cooks use to sear the burger without drying it out.  ""You change one parameter and it changes everything, and so you have to test over and over and over again,"" Jasper said. A few one-off successes weren't enough, he added. ""You have to do something you can replicate. When you start doing the math, it's millions of times a day across our system.""  Once Jasper had figured out how to make the new ingredient work, he invited Gross — a sponsor of his food journey team — to one of his restaurants to try it out. When she tasted the fresh beef burger, Gross said, she went from being ""a skeptic to a believer."" But others remained skeptical.  When McDonald's first started testing out its fresh beef burger in 2016, some franchisees reportedly said they were against the switch. One operator worried about ""an uncaring employee doing something that puts the entire system at risk,"" CNBC reported, citing a survey of about 27 franchisees who together owned and operated roughly 200 restaurants. They pointed to Chipotle, which took a major financial and reputational hit after E. coli outbreaks at its restaurants sickened customers, as a cautionary tale.  ""We are the lightning rod,"" the franchisee said, according to CNBC. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""  Franchisees own and operate about 93% of McDonald's restaurants, so getting them on board with the idea was crucial to its success.  Focus on safety  Franchise operators weren't the only ones worried about food safety. That was Gross's main concern about making the switch, too. ""I lost a couple of winks of sleep over that one,"" she said.  Fresh beef is not inherently more difficult to prepare than frozen. But there are important differences between how fresh and frozen meat needs to be handled. Cooks must be mindful of contamination when handling fresh beef — basically, they need to make sure that raw burger juice doesn't end up in other food or ingredients.  For employees, the new ingredient meant re-learning a skill that may have become second nature, Gross said. ""For years they were used to following the same procedures, and probably most of them could do it in their sleep,"" she noted. ""This was a big change.""  With the guidance of a third-party food safety expert, McDonald's put new practices into place. It instructed employees to wear blue gloves when handling the fresh beef, to make sure that other food products weren't accidentally contaminated. Members of the corporate team made sure that employees at McDonald's thousands of US restaurants had been trained correctly before the launch.  To prepare a fresh beef burger, employees take the patty from the fridge and place it directly on a flat iron grill. While it's cooking, the cook adds a pinch of salt and pepper to bring out flavor. The fresh burgers cook more quickly than frozen ones.  Changes also had to be made on the supply and distribution side. Suppliers, used to sending frozen patties to McDonald's, needed new packaging equipment and refrigeration capacity, among other things, to make sure the fresh beef was handled safely. Lopez Foods was the first supplier to sell fresh beef to McDonald's. In order to accommodate the new product, Lopez had to build new lines. That meant new grinders and packaging equipment, among other tools. It converted one of its freezers into a refrigerator to store the meat. Switching from fresh to frozen also means Lopez has to be more nimble with its shipments. With a frozen product, they could plan far in advance for McDonald's promotions that would increase the number of orders. With a perishable product, that planning time shrinks.  And Lopez had to make all of these investments up front, with no guarantee that the changes would yield results.  ""It's a big change for us, it's a big change for the restaurant operationally. And there were questions around whether that could be executed,"" said Ed Sanchez, CEO of Lopez Foods. ""I had doubts along the way. But as it progressed along, it was less and less doubt. And there came a point to where it was crystal clear that we had to do this. The customer wanted it.""  Fresh beef has a shorter shelf life than frozen, noted Dale Rogers, professor of logistics and supply chain management at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. This means that it needs to be brought from the suppliers to McDonald's more quickly than frozen beef.  Technological innovations, like sensors, can help make it easier for McDonald's to ensure that the beef has been kept at the right temperature throughout its journey, said Rogers. Years ago, it would have been more difficult for McDonald's to make sure that the meat is properly refrigerated all the way through. Still, it's a major overhaul, he said. But If anyone can pull it off, it's McDonald's.  ""It's a very disciplined culture,"" he said. ""McDonald's has had the same suppliers for many, many years,"" he added. ""The relationship is extremely tight."" When it comes to managing its supply chain, ""McDonald's is one of the best of the best,"" said Dale. To get suppliers on board, Gross started small.  ""A lot of that up front was really just getting people comfortable with the idea of a change this big, a move this bold for a company with our scale and our size,"" Gross said.  After getting Lopez Foods on board, ""it was time to bring on the next supplier,"" said Gross. ""We had all this learning from Lopez Foods that could very quickly be shared with supplier number two. Then they brought their production lines up and going, and they had a bunch of learning as well.""  Sanchez is pleased with the results of the switch, he said. ""We were satisfied with our investment and our return on investment,"" he noted, adding, ""it grew the business for us.""  Getting its suppliers to work together is a ""competitive advantage,"" said Gross. ""Their interests, like ours, is in the success of the McDonald's system."" Constant improvement  With its roughly 14,000 US locations and $38.5 billion in 2018 US sales, McDonald's far outpaces its competition. Wendy's, the next biggest burger chain according to QSR Magazine's most recent annual list, closed out 2018 with about 6,700 locations and nearly $10 billion in US sales. Burger King's 7,300 US locations also pulled in about $10 billion in US sales in 2018.  With McDonald's so far ahead, it doesn't really need to worry about the competition, noted Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine. What it does have to worry about is staying relevant.  ""You still want your customers to choose McDonald's over Wendy's and Burger King, but you also want your customers to choose McDonald's over Five Guys,"" Oches said.  Better burger and fast casual chains started gaining momentum after the 2008 recession, when people were looking for spots that served higher quality meals than fast food chains but were less expensive than casual restaurants. By 2015, both the fast casual and better burger trends were well established. And burger chains like Wendy's and In-N-Out, which built their reputations on serving fresh beef, were shouting out their message.  ""The more that the mass audience is hearing these stories about fresh beef and better burgers, the more that old frozen patty really wasn't going to cut it,"" said Kara Nielsen, a food trend expert based in Oakland, California.  McDonald's has experimented with high-quality and craft burgers, but pricey options haven't worked well for the brand. And complicated burgers may add to prep time, which can mean longer lines and wait times in stores.  Still, McDonald's could have skipped this trend because of its massive scale. Speaking at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in May 2018, Easterbrook, still CEO of McDonald's at the time, explained why it was so important to figure out a way to improve the chain's burgers.  ""We're a burger business at our heart,"" he said. ""If you want to really get the core business growing day in, day out, what changes can you make to the items you sell most of that customers would value?"" By making it's thickest burger, the Quarter Pounder, hotter and juicier, McDonald's can give customers the most bang for their buck.  The fast food chain is constantly trying to improve its menu. ""That includes enhancing or improving, making our iconic burgers and product offerings better too,"" Gross said, noting that making the shift to fresh beef ""was probably the most difficult change that we made since we made the move to all day breakfast.""  For now, the risk is paying off. ""The customers are voting by coming in and visiting us more often,"" said Gross.  ""It all goes back to listening to the customer, and what the customer wants, and how their needs and wants are changing,"" she said. ""Then us being able to demonstrate that number one, we're listening to them. Number two, we're taking action and we're making the moves that are important to them, even with our iconic food product."" ",3/24/2020

And more at-home studios are popping up every day — yet another consequence of the coronavirus pandemic that has upended life all across the United States. Media companies are following the same social distancing guidelines as other industries. And some broadcasters are self-quarantining because they've been in close proximity with people who tested positive for the virus. What's lost: Multi-million dollar studios and the video quality that comes with it. What's gained: Efficiency and intimacy. Live shots from home are candid and relatable, showing viewers that their favorite TV personalities are stuck in the same stay-at-home boat. Broadcasting live...from the basement Savannah Guthrie and Al Roker of NBC's ""Today"" show have been at home since last week. Part of Guthrie's basement has been converted into a studio. She posted a photo from her director's chair to Instagram and asked, ""Is there a statute of limitations on how many days in a row you can wear the same sweatpants?"" Some of the changes have happened gradually, as with the Fox News morning show ""Fox & Friends,"" which was slow to recognize the severity of the crisis. The co-hosts typically gather on a couch to deliver right-wing news and commentary, but last week, as social distancing became the norm, they were stationed in different corners of the studio. This week, they are working remotely ""in locations closer to our homes,"" co-host Steve Doocy said on the air. Robin Roberts of ABC's ""Good Morning America"" started to broadcast from home on Wednesday, as well. ""It is hard to leave because you want the normalcy. You want it not just for yourself but for our viewers,"" she said on Tuesday's ""GMA."" But Roberts has underlying medical conditions, including a rare blood disorder, so her doctor has recommended that she remain home. Anthony Mason of ""CBS This Morning"" also stayed at home Wednesday. ""I'm self-quarantining,"" he said on the show. ""I've had contact with a family member who has not tested positive but has one of the symptoms that could be coronavirus."" Mason said he felt fine. He went live via a cell phone ""propped up on a stack of books,"" he tweeted. Remote shows have quickly become normal all across TV. CNN's Anderson Cooper anchored ""AC360"" from his home last Friday after a person on his show's team fell ill. On Monday, he updated viewers: ""My staff is all still working from home. Tonight, I'm in a remote studio with robotic cameras. I'm not in contact with anyone else."" Cooper has had no symptoms of the virus. Even for the programs that still have anchors working from their usual studios, television networks have drastically cut back staffing levels for control rooms and other key functions. On Sunday night CNN boss Jeff Zucker, the chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports, wrote in a memo that ""more than 90 percent of our global staff is now working from home. ""But there are still members of the team in the field and in our offices because what we are doing has been deemed essential, and I want to express my thanks to them, as well,"" Zucker wrote. At NBC News, President Noah Oppenheim told staffers Monday that ""over 90%"" of staff ""based at 30 Rock are now working remotely."" ""Most of our anchors, correspondents and contributors now also have at-home studios,"" Oppenheim wrote in an internal memo. ""And in many of our control rooms, as few as three people — all sitting at least 6 feet apart — are getting our shows on the air."" At the PBS ""NewsHour"" over the weekend, Saturday and Sunday's broadcasts were assembled entirely remotely — ""meaning no control room, no studio,"" anchor Hari Sreenivasan told CNN. Sreenivasan filmed from his apartment, reporters worked from theirs, and editors and producers all worked from their own homes. Sreenivasan said he used Zoom videoconferencing to record his reports. He shared this technique with the audience ""by turning the set 'on' in front of them,"" he pointed out. These types of broadcasts are made possible by state-of-the-art streaming tech, but some of the workarounds are pretty simple. Sreenivasan ran a TelePrompTer by scrolling on a wireless mouse. On Tuesday, CNN's Dana Bash interviewed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the air from a Cisco Webex videoconferencing desk device in her home. From daytime to late night The abundance-of-caution approach has extended to talk shows and late-night comedy hours. ""Live with Kelly and Ryan"" resumed on Monday with both Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest joining via Skype. Seacrest used a stack of books to prop up an iPad and a laptop computer for the show. When guest Jerry O'Connell joined ""Live"" on Tuesday and suffered from a poor connection, he jokingly tweeted, ""Sorry about my poor internet. My kids sucking it all up with their TikTok and we have a limited data plan."" Technical glitches do crop up from time to time — but it's remarkable how stable the TV coverage has been, all things considered. Engineers have been working long hours to keep things running. To name just one example, CBS News moved out of its main New York offices last week following an outbreak of coronavirus, and ""CBS This Morning"" has emanated from ""The Late Show"" stage a few blocks away at the Ed Sullivan Theater ever since. ""The Late Show"" and other late-night shows have also been producing rough-around-the-edges monologues and other comedy from hosts' homes. ""The Daily Show"" has been renamed ""The Daily Social Distancing Show"" while Trevor Noah hosts from his Manhattan apartment. On Tuesday, HBO said that ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" would return on Sunday with a program from Oliver's residence. Digital news outlets have also transitioned to remote working models. Politico told staffers on Tuesday that work-from-home will continue through May 4. Magazines like The New Yorker have been successfully published from home for the first time ever. (The lone exception is the physical printing process.) Will Welch, the editor of GQ, told CNN that ""unprecedented times call for unprecedented ideas."" ""On one hand we can't do traditional photo shoots or in-person reporting during social distancing and self-quarantine,"" he said. ""On the other, there is so much powerful technology at our disposal that we get to harness in new ways. So we're doing meetings on Zoom, asking subjects to photograph themselves, going live on Instagram, asking artists and other creative people in our community to make stuff for us, and doing our reporting over the phone."" Most importantly, he said, he and his colleagues ""are just grateful we can still get up in the morning and do the work, no matter how different or how stressful the circumstances. It's a huge privilege in a moment when so many people cannot go do their jobs.""",3/25/2020

Walmart (WMT) and other big grocers have implemented limits in recent days on purchases of eggs, cleaning supplies and other products that are in high demand from customers. ""Consumers are panic shopping and, much like we see ahead of a snow storm, they are purchasing staple items (milk, bread, toilet paper, and eggs). Except obviously this is on a national scale and for a much longer period of time,"" said Brian Moscogiuri, director and egg analyst at Urner Barry, a commodity market research firm. Retailers are ordering up to six times their normal egg volumes and have depleted the supply that producers were beginning to build for Easter, he said. ""Buyers have paid huge premiums to secure loads.""  Wholesale egg prices have risen 180% since the beginning of March, according to Urner Barry, which publishes a daily benchmark for the industry. ""Wholesale prices for shell eggs rose precipitously through the week,"" the Department of Agriculture said in its weekly report Friday. Companies were struggling to ""maintain sufficient stocks to meet a heightened level of consumer demand."" Grocery Outlet (GO) President Robert Sheedy noted price inflation on eggs during a call with analysts on Tuesday. When suppliers' prices rise, grocers are faced with two options: Pass off the cost to consumers or take the hit to profit. They are doing both. ""Due to a limited supply and higher than usual demand, our suppliers have increased their prices on eggs,"" a sign posted at Stop & Shop in Boston said. ""As a result, you may see higher prices starting Saturday, March 21, as well as potential interruptions in supply."" Dennis Curtin, a spokesperson for Weis Markets in the northeast, said the grocer has taken ""limited pricing action so far."" Suppliers have notified the company that egg prices have increased. Egg prices have increased by 14% at Morton Williams stores in New York. The company is frustrated that it's paying double for eggs from its suppliers during a crisis. ""It is unconscionable that the egg industry has doubled prices because of increased demand. It is hitting low-income New Yorkers the hardest, as so many have lost their jobs working in restaurants and hotels,"" said Avi Kaner, a spokesperson for Morton Williams.",3/25/2020

But we're not able to see inside the emergency rooms and intensive care units where this invisible demon is being fought. We're not able to see the front lines. Or the full extent of the human suffering. We only hear about the battle through the testimonies of doctors and nurses; though the pleas of governors and mayors; and through interviews with patients who are well enough to call in via Skype. Does this distort the public's understanding of the virus? Does the lack of visibility make it hard for some folks to process how serious this pandemic is? I asked Esther Choo, emergency physician and health care advocate who started the #GetMePPE hashtag last week. Yes, she said via text, ""this whole thing has been hampered by its abstractness. I mean, half the interviews on TV that I've seen are totally well people pissed they didn't get tested."" But they're not the real faces of this pandemic — the hospitalized patients are.

Trump's base strategy On Wednesday I heard from sources at multiple TV networks who said it is getting more difficult to book interviews with Trump admin officials about the pandemic. Officials are favoring Fox News and turning down most interview requests from other networks.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/business/airlines-bailout-outlook-coronavirus/index.html,$50 billion airline bailout won't be enough to save US industry ,"Only passengers can do that. ""We have an airline industry right now that is flying empty planes,"" said airline consultant Mike Boyd. ""This isn't going to save the industry unless we get back in business of flying people."" From April through June of last year alone, US airlines' revenue totaled $64.4 billion, according to Transportation Department data. But it is getting only a small fraction of that revenue stream right now. The latest figures from the Transportation Security Administration shows passenger traffic through checkpoints at only 8% of year ago levels as of Thursday. And revenue is off even more than that because fares have also plunged. Bookings for flights in coming weeks and months have also ground to a halt.  Airlines are now cutting their schedules for April and May by 60% to 80% because of the drop in traffic. But the planes still flying won't have nearly enough passengers to be profitable. The canceling of flights, along with the grounding of aircraft and employees taking unpaid leave, will help. It cuts fuel costs -- the second biggest expense for airlines after wages -- and it will also reduce maintenance expense.  But the only thing that will end this crisis is for passengers to begin buying airline tickets, and soon. ""The general assumption is that the rest of the year will not look as grim as the second quarter, but it will be a slow recovery,"" said Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for the airline industry at Standard and Poor's. ""I think that [recovery] depends a lot on how the disease and the government actions progress, and how bad the economic damage is."" The Senate's bailout package, which deals with the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, will give airlines $25 billion in direct grants as long as they agree not to place any employees on involuntary furloughs or discontinue service at any airports they now serve until at least the end of September. Another $25 billion is available for loan guarantees. Salaries and benefits cost the US airline $35.2 billion in the six month period from April to September last year. The industry had about 750,000 employees at the start of this year.  The $25 billion in grants won't cover all of those salary costs, although unpaid leaves, executive pay cuts and reduced hours for unionized employees will reduce those labor costs from year-ago levels. But the biggest concern is whether traffic will recover to previous levels after the crisis. There's reason to believe it won't anytime soon.  No one knows how long the public will be urged to heed warnings to stay inside and avoid unessential travel. Lifted too soon, those restrictions could spark a second round of new cases of the disease and yet more restrictions on activity.  It's also unclear how much economic damage has been done to consumers' budgets, or whether they will even be willing to travel in the near term. And some business travel could be curtailed, either because  businesses have less to spend on travel, or because the crisis showed companies they needn't travel as much as they once did. ""It's going to be a gradual recovery,"" said Baggaley. ""Airlines will probably be one of the last industries to recover."" On Friday top executives at United Airlines (UAL) warned employees that while the bailout prevents any involuntary staff cuts for the next six months, reductions are likely in the future since it's traffic is unlikely to return to prior levels in the foreseeable future.  ""Based on how doctors expect the virus to spread and how economists expect the global economy to react, we expect demand to remain suppressed ... possibly into next year,"" said the letter from United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby. ""We will continue to plan for the worst and hope for a faster recovery .... [However] if the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today."" Experts expect international travel to be affected far longer than domestic air travel. International flights, in addition to being more profitable for the US airlines that fly globally, account for nearly a third of passengers on domestic flights, Boyd said. That's because international travelers fly around the country, and US passengers take domestic flights to get to or from international gateways. ""We're talking about at least six to eight months down the road before flying starts to resume at anything approaching normal,"" said Boyd. ""And even then, we're likely to see a significant reduction. One way or another, we're going to have a smaller airline industry."" -- CNN's Alicia Wallace and Greg Wallace contributed to this report",3/28/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/04/tech/nasa-management-apollo-silicon-valley-scn/index.html,How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"President John F. Kennedy's iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface. The Apollo program was the birthplace of the modern tech ecosystem, says Basil Hero, a former investigative reporter and media executive who authored the new book ""The Mission of a Lifetime.""  ""Without [Apollo], I don't think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,"" Hero told CNN Business. ""It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years."" Apollo, the startup NASA's Apollo program was the first-ever ""moonshot."" And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.  Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA's administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move ""any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,"" Hero writes in ""The Mission of a Lifetime."" The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business. Congress was the Apollo program's financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer ""supergrade"" salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book. But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years. Enter George Mueller. He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA's human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency's history office describes him as ""a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader"" who ""introduced a remarkable series of management changes."" Mueller created a ""flat organization"" structure: He cut out middle management and ""made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,"" Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn't working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course. ""They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,"" Hero said. Today, California's hive of startups and tech giants, from Facebook to Google, still swear by the same management technique. ""Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,"" Netflix (NFLX) notes in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. ""We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix — giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions."" Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box. Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes. Making more moonshots In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011 book. The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs built off computing technology that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said. Some of the tech titans that dominate today's headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own. Elon Musk, who made a fortune off Paypal (PYPL) and now runs Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, declared that he will relentlessly pursue the goal of reviving deep-space exploration technologies with a rocket that can take humans to Mars. Jeff Bezos, the multibillionaire behind Amazon (AMZN), has brought up the moon landing as a source of inspiration in numerous interviews and public speeches. He's personally funding his own space venture, Blue Origin, that hopes to be instrumental in returning humans to the moon.",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/business/food-supply-disruption-coronavirus-us/index.html,What happens to our food supply if American farmers can't farm? ,"The coronavirus pandemic is posing a threat to their livelihoods, as it is for many others across the globe. But unlike some shelf-stable goods producers, farmers have very little flexibility. They're on a strict planting and harvesting schedule and cannot ramp up or decrease production at will.  ""A peach [that] is good today is not good tomorrow. That's how quick things ripen,"" Chalmers Carr told CNN Business. Carr owns and operates Titan Farms in Ridge Spring, South Carolina, where he grows peaches on around 6,200 acres, in addition to bell peppers and broccoli. For blueberries and strawberries, he said, ""if you leave them on the bush or the vine one extra day, they're virtually worthless."" Even more forgiving crops, like bell peppers, have a short harvesting window of two to five days, Carr said.   April and May are critical planting and harvesting times for many US farmers. They need skilled laborers to work their fields, and a reliable supply chain to deliver their goods. And they don't have any time to waste.  If farmers can't find enough workers or if their farming practices are disrupted because of the pandemic, Americans could have less or pricier food this summer. And because international farmers and their supply chains face similar problems, we could receive fewer food imports, potentially limiting supply and driving up prices. In recent weeks, many Americans got a scare when they walked into grocery stores and found empty shelves. Those shortages are caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain, not a lack of food, so grocery stores have been able to replenish their shelves fairly quickly.  What happens over the next several months will determine whether those disruptions become more serious.  Farmers are scrambling to solve problems as they arise, and it's unlikely that we'll run out of food. But this year and next, we may not see the bounty we're accustomed to.  A foreign workforce  As efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic limit consular services, US farmers are worried they won't be able to hire the international workers they rely on.  ""We are a sector that is very dependent upon guest workers coming into this country, particularly for the planting and harvesting of specialty crops [like] fresh fruits and vegetables,"" said Chuck Conner, president and CEO of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.  According to the USDA, in fiscal year 2005 the government distributed 48,000 H-2A visas, which grant foreign workers temporary access to the country as agricultural workers. In fiscal year 2018, that figure had quintupled to about 243,000. Because the average length of the visa stay was about five months, the agency estimates that those visas were the equivalent of 108,000 full-year positions.  The spike in the number of visa holders is ""one of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor,"" said the USDA.  The 2015-2016 National Agricultural Workers Survey, the most recent of its kind, found that 69% of hired farm workers interviewed for the survey were born in Mexico. Only 24% were born in the United States.  H-2A workers have been deemed essential by the government, and should be allowed to work in the United States. These workers don't seem to be avoiding coming to the United States for fear of catching Covid-19 — the economic incentive is just too large to give up, Carr said. But workers may eventually decide it's too risky to enter the United States.  And if they do have a hard time getting in, it's not clear that domestic labor will be able to fill in the gap.  Labor mismatch  It might seem like there's an obvious solution to the problem. US unemployment claims have reached unprecedented levels as businesses close their doors because of the pandemic. In the week ending March 21, initial jobless claims reached a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million — the largest number since the Department of Labor started keeping track of the claims in 1967.  People currently seeking work could find it on farms. But most of the newly unemployed are not qualified.  ""It's very skilled labor,"" said Tom Stenzel, president and CEO of the United Fresh Produce Association. ""If you're a peach picker, you're very different than a strawberry picker. And the ability to handle the volume and keep up with the pace — it's a professional job.""  People without experience could theoretically transition to agricultural work, he said. ""Farmers will hire anybody that they could right now, I would bet you."" But they wouldn't be very efficient, and could slow down farm operations, he added.  And it's unlikely that unemployed Americans will actually seek agricultural jobs, or relocate to take that type of work. Carr said that in general, he's found it very difficult to recruit American workers. ""There was no domestic workforce for me,"" he said.  ""It's tough work, out bending over, harvesting crops all day,"" Stenzel said. ""It's very hard to get Americans to do that."" Red tape  The government has been racing to adapt its ordinary procedures to this extraordinary situation, but it's not clear that its efforts will be enough.  Adjustments and tweaks to visa processing and other protocols have been made as problems arise. In light of concerns that workers won't be allowed into the country because they can't have in-person interviews, the State Department is allowing consular officers to waive those interviews for some. But it's hard to predict the bumps in the road, especially because government efforts to prevent the spread of the virus have been changing dramatically over short periods of time. Those ad-hoc measures may be enough for now, said Carr. But if the pandemic stops domestic agricultural workers from doing their jobs over the next two or three months, US farmers will need a new influx of international employees. The current adjustments don't offer a road map for that possibility.  Plus, farm laborers face the same threats that other essential employees do. While many Americans are instructed to stay home, they're expected to go out to work every day. They may get sick, and be quarantined or unable to work. Or they may have to work less to take care of children or relatives. Social distancing practices may disrupt how they function, and introduce friction into their normal farming processes.  That goes for other critical employees across the supply chain, like truck drivers. It also applies to farmers in other countries: They too could get sick, quarantined, or have to stay at home to care for loved ones, and they have their own supply chain disruptions to consider.  International disruptions Much of the fresh fruits and vegetables that are consumed in the United States are grown internationally. The FDA said last year that about 32% of fresh vegetables and 55% of fresh fruit consumed in the United States each year are imported.  That doesn't mean that half of apples, or a third of potatoes, come from abroad. Certain fruit, like bananas, are grown almost entirely outside of the United States. And imports tend to increase or decrease depending on the time of year — you can buy fruit out of season because they've been grown elsewhere.  If those other countries aren't able to produce as much as usual, Americans could see fewer fruits or vegetables out of season. And the ones that get here may be more expensive.  ""Supply shortfalls would drive prices up, and yes, you'd get less,"" said Andrew Muhammad, a professor of agricultural, food, and natural resource policy at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture.  Even if international farms are not interrupted, imports may be held up because of staffing shortages at shipping ports, he said. And if ships are stalled at docks because of decreased labor, or if storage facilities aren't emptied out to make space for new products, Muhammad added, those countries' export markets could suffer.  Still, that doesn't necessarily mean international markets won't be able to meet US demand. But it does mean that producers, here and abroad, will have a hard time planning for the future.  Uncertainty ahead  Growers are ""planting right now for late spring, summer,"" said Ed O'Malley, vice president of supply and merchandising at Imperfect Foods, a discount grocery delivery service that sells so-called ugly produce to help prevent food waste. ""They've gotta be wondering, 'how many acres of lettuce or green beans do I plant?'""   Before the pandemic, demand in food service was ""very predictable,"" he added. But now, with restaurants closing their doors and grocery stores seeing surges in purchases, it'll be harder for farmers to know how much they'll be able to sell and to whom.  ""For a grower to go ahead and plant 2,000 acres when he's really only going to need 1,200, boy, that's a very expensive proposition,"" O'Malley said.  The inability to plan could exacerbate the country's food waste problem, and make it harder for the food insecure to eat.  It will take grocery stores some time to readjust to changes in demand. Prices for some staples, such as eggs, have surged as demand far outstrips supply. And some US food banks ""reported a sharp decrease from food retail donors due to the stockpiling that has occurred throughout the country,"" Blake Thompson, chief supply chain officer at Feeding America, a national network of about 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs, told CNN Business in an email.  But some food has been diverted successfully from one venue to another. Baldor, in New York City, generally sells food to restaurants, schools and other food service outlets. Now, it is offering delivery to individuals. Imperfect Foods was able to accdept food meant for airlines, said company co-founder Ben Chesler. ""We've seen lots of offers come in [from] companies that have been made for food service."" Between the disruptions, uncertainty and shocks to the global supply chain, the situation is unstable but not hopeless, experts say.  ""You can't throw too much of a worse scenario at producers than what they currently have,"" said Conner of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.  ""Our system has responded well. And I think that's going to continue,"" he added. ""I know that's a bold prediction because the world is being turned upside down here, and I recognize that. But I have great confidence in this system's ability to respond and get food to the people where they need it."" ",4/1/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/tech/bill-nye-light-sail-2-solar-spacecraft-scn/index.html,Bill Nye's experimental spacecraft that sails on sunlight declares mission success ,"The prototype spacecraft is the work of the Planetary Society, an international nonprofit headed by famed science communicator Bill Nye. Its mission was declared a success on Wednesday, marking the culmination of a years-long effort to prove a satellite can surf through space using sunlight as an endless fuel supply. It has nothing to do with solar panels: Plenty of satellites already use that technology to convert the sun's energy to electricity. Solar sailing is a different, centuries-old concept. It suggests spacecraft can be propelled by a slow, constant push from photons, which are light particles that have no mass but still carry momentum. ""It's counter-intuitive, it's surprising, and to me it's very romantic,"" Nye told reporters during a a press call Wednesday, ""to be sailing on sunbeams."" The Planetary Society spent a decade working up to the LightSail 2 mission and scraping together the $7 million needed to get the project off the ground. All told, 50,000 supporters from 109 countries donated to the initiative, according to Planetary Society COO Jennifer Vaughn. LightSail 2 boarded its long-awaited flight to space in June, secured alongside two dozen other payloads on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. The satellite reached its intended orbit and, on June 23, it unfurled razor-thin sheets of polyester to form a 32-square-meter sail.  After some trial and error, LightSail 2 was able to maneuver its sail to harness photons' momentum, which offered a ""tiny push no stronger than the weight of a paperclip"" each time the spacecraft lapped Earth, according to the Planetary Society.  The gentle nudges added up. In just a few days, LightSail 2's distance from Earth grew by about 1.7 km, or about one mile, said project manager David Spencer. The future of solar sail The first solar sail prototype, a product of Japan's space agency, flew to space in 2010. Planetary Society had hoped to reach that milestone years earlier, but its first solar sail was destroyed during a rocket explosion in 2005. LightSail 2 was built to be the best-performing solar sail yet. After its successful flight, Nye said, Planetary Society was now ready to pass the baton off to other organizations. ""We have no plans to do a third light sail right now,"" he said. Though he listed a few types of exploration missions he hoped to see powered by solar sails — including long-distance trips to rendezvous with threatening asteroids, or missions to monitor the sun's weather and provide warning for potentially catastrophic solar flareups. LightSail 2 does not, however, have any obvious business applications. But the 50,000 backers who put money into the project aren't expecting to get a dime back, Vaughn said. ""The type of return on investment these people get is just knowledge,"" Vaughn said Wednesday. ""It's capability. That's the kind of returns these people are looking for.""",3/24/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/perspectives/stimulus-checks-undocumented-taxpayers/index.html,These taxpayers won't get stimulus checks. That's unjust,"Unfortunately, the Senate proposal does not include all taxpayers. Those who file their taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) instead of a Social Security number have been left out, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Omitting these taxpayers will exclude many of the American taxpayers who are most vulnerable in the current crisis: undocumented immigrants. Failing to aid these workers will be disastrous to them and their families and will have a significant negative impact on the economy. If the Senate bill is passed without amendment by the House and signed by the president, it will not be the first time that taxpayers who file their taxes with an ITIN will not receive stimulus checks. In 2008, when our country issued similar checks, not only were taxpayers who filed with ITINs excluded -- so were those with a valid Social Security Number who jointly filed a return with a spouse with an ITIN (with a limited exception for military families).  In hindsight, it's clear immigrants suffered disproportionately as a result of the Great Recession. For example, in 2008 alone, Hispanic immigrants' unemployment rate jumped from 5.1% to 8%, a significantly greater increase than among other American workers. Since 1996, ITINs have been issued by the IRS to individuals ineligible for a Social Security Number -- mostly (though not exclusively) because they are immigrants who are undocumented.  In an effort to encourage these undocumented immigrants to file and pay their taxes, the IRS has long highlighted that it maintains a wall of separation from the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for immigration enforcement. ""We want your money whether you are here legally or not and whether you earned it legally or not,"" IRS Commissioner Mark Everson said in 2007. Even in an era of increased rhetoric about immigration enforcement, federal tax law continues to prevent these taxpayers' information from being shared for immigration enforcement purposes. Many undocumented immigrants have taken the IRS at its word: By 2015, more than 4 million people annually were using ITINs to pay $4.35 billion in net taxes. These unauthorized immigrants are concentrated in the industries likely to be most immediately impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Though only about 5% of the US labor force overall is undocumented, they make up 10% or more of those working in the accommodation and food preparation and service sectors. The women and men who clean hotel rooms are either being laid off or are having their hours dramatically reduced. In addition, servers, cooks and dishwashers are all among those likely to be let go due to this crisis. They need economic relief urgently. From an economic perspective, I know that lower-income people -- including most who would pay their taxes with an ITIN -- are the most likely to quickly spend a stimulus check, precisely because they do not have the financial margin to save. If $2,200 was sent to a single parent with two children who was previously earning $12 per hour, they would likely use the funds to buy groceries, pay a cell phone bill or cover a car, rent or mortgage payment. This is the money which continues to circulate in the US economy. Unlike those with significantly higher earnings, hourly workers generally are not in a position to simply save those funds for a rainy day -- that rainy day has come and the water is up to their necks. Undocumented immigrants -- who are contributing taxes yet are generally ineligible for social safety net programs, such as food stamps, subsidized housing or Medicaid -- are among those most at risk of hunger or eviction from their homes in the current crisis. Given that many lack medical insurance, they are also least likely to seek and receive health care if they contract COVID-19. Roughly 5 million US-born children of undocumented immigrants will also bear the weight of these impacts.  I'm not dismissing the reality that these immigrants have violated US immigration law, either by entering the country unlawfully or overstaying a temporary visa. Like other evangelical leaders at World Relief, I have opposed calls for amnesty, arguing instead for a restitution-based immigration reform, that establishes a process by which undocumented immigrants could get right with the law if they pay a penalty for their violation of law. Were Congress to take up such reforms, our experience at World Relief providing legal services to tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants suggests most would be eager to pay such a fine and make amends. But in the midst of this crisis, congressional action on immigration reform is not likely to happen quickly. What can happen is that Congress can acknowledge that these undocumented immigrants have complied with IRS requirements to file and pay their taxes utilizing an ITIN. We should be fair to these American taxpayers, among the most vulnerable at all times but more so now. Congress should move quickly to send stimulus checks -- and send them, in particular, to these uniquely vulnerable taxpayers.",3/26/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/business/ford-3m-ge-ventilators-coronavirus-duplicate-2/index.html,Ford is working with 3M and GE to make respirators and ventilators,"Healthcare workers around the country have expressed concern about difficulties in attaining enough critical supplies, such as masks, gloves and ventilators, to deal with the influx of patients suffering from the highly contagious virus. Ford said it will work with 3M (MMM) to produce a new kind of Powered Air-Purifying Respirator for healthcare workers, while also helping to increase production of 3M's current respirator device. A PAPR has a clear mask that fits over the face. Air is drawn in through a tube connected to a pump that filters the air. The PAPR will be made using parts from both Ford and 3M, the automaker said, including fans used in the Ford F-150's optional ventilated seats.  Ford (F) said it is exploring the possibility of producing the device at one of its Michigan factories. 3M will also make the respirators at its own factory, Ford said. Ford also announced that it's working with GE Healthcare to increase production of ventilators, sophisticated air pumps needed by some critically ill coronavirus patients. It is not clear exactly how Ford will help GE to make more ventilators. ""Working with 3M and GE, we have empowered our teams of engineers and designers to be scrappy and creative to quickly help scale up production of this vital equipment,"" Ford CEO Jim Hackett said in the company's announcement. ""We've been in regular dialogue with federal, state and local officials to understand the areas of greatest needs."" The automaker also said it will work with the United Auto Workers Union to assemble clear plastic face shields that protect people from possibly infectious bodily fluids. The Ford-designed masks are being tested at Detroit-area hospitals. They could be used by healthcare workers, but also others, such as store clerks, who must regularly deal with the public. Ford is also using 3D printers at its Advanced Manufacturing Center to create disposable air-filtering respirator masks. Once approved, Ford said, the company could initially 1,000 masks per month but hopes to increase production as quickly as possible. Other major US automakers have also made similar announcements.  General Motors (GM) said last Friday that it was going to work with Ventec Life Systems to help increase its production of ventilators for hospital patients. On Monday, the two companies announced that Ventec ""is now planning exponentially higher ventilator production as fast as possible"" as a result of the partnership. GM said it is also looking into producing the devices at its Kokomo, Indiana, electronics assembly plant. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has also said on Twitter that his company could make ventilators if needed.  Last Saturday he tweeted that he had had ""a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators."" Medtronic (MDT) confirmed that it has had discussions with Musk.  Musk has not given any specific timetable for producing ventilators, though, and did not say what his companies and Medtronic might do together. Tesla spokespeople did not respond to requests for more information. ""Medtronic will work with Tesla and others to try and solve this ventilator supply challenge,"" a Medtronic spokeperson told CNN Business in an email. The company also did not provide any information about how Musk's companies could help in the production of more ventilators. On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters that Musk had donated 1,000 ventilators. Musk Tweeted later that those ventilators had been purchased from China, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  (FCAU)also announced Monday it would produce as many as 1 million protective face masks a week that it would donate to hospitals, police and emergency personnel dealing with coronavirus patients. All four automakers announced last week that they would temporarily shut down production of cars and SUVs at their US factories in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/business/boulder-county-colorado-jump-average-weekly-wages/index.html,How this county's paychecks jumped 18%,"The region northwest of Denver got an 18.5% spike in its average weekly wages during the third quarter of 2019 from the year before, according to Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data.  The astonishing jump was influenced by an anomaly: the C-Suite windfall from Pfizer's blockbuster $11 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma. But the underlying data released this month provide a window into what happens when Silicon Valley giants set up shop and spread in a small community.  ""I'd say that is a very real underpinning in our Colorado metropolitan economy now is tech companies,"" said economist Brian Lewandowski, who heads the Business Research Division at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus.  For an area like Boulder, wage growth shouldn't come as a surprise. The region has boasted a steady economic expansion since the Great Recession and an ""innovation economy"" that's lured the likes of IBM and Ball Aerospace decades ago and Google and Apple today. ""We're seeing these Fortune 500 companies with some dimension of advanced technology in their work not only setting up shop here but growing here,"" said Clif Harald, executive director of the Boulder Economic Council, the economic development wing of the region's chamber of commerce. Going beyond the numbers Boulder County's wage growth rate represented the largest increase in the QCEW in 2.5 years and the fourth largest since 2015; however, it's not uncommon to see dramatic swings in quarterly average weekly wages.  The QCEW data represent total compensation paid, so frequently packed into the quarterly numbers are one-time items like bonuses, severance and stock options. The data can oftentimes show how business activity such as mergers, acquisitions, layoffs and IPOs are funneling out into the local community. Boulder County's bountiful third-quarter data appear to show the ripple effects from Pfizer's acquisition of Array, which closed on July 30, 2019. The deal was expected to result in payouts of several-hundred million dollars to Array executives. The full QCEW data show that one particular business sector, biotechnology research and development, saw a nearly $34,000 rise in the average weekly paychecks -- a 1,031% jump. The year-over-year change in quarterly wages in that sector was $476 million. Excluding that outlier third quarter, Boulder County's wages still grew by a rolling average of 6.3% over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2019, according to QCEW and Colorado Department of Labor and Employment data. That outpaces the national growth by 3 percentage points.  Two key factors playing into that growth for Boulder County are historically low jobless rates and an influx of higher-paying professional and technical services jobs, said Ryan Gedney, senior economist for Colorado's labor department.  In 2019, Boulder County had an unemployment rate of 2.4%, which is lower than both Colorado and the United States, at 2.8% and 3.7%, respectively, according to Colorado Department of Labor and Employment and Local Area Unemployment Statistics data.  ""Different companies are vying for workers,"" he said. ""That's going to push up wage rates."" A tech hub grows  Professional and technical services -- think R&D and computer design -- have been this region's bread and butter for years. Boulder County has the third-highest concentration of professional and technical service employment among the nation's metropolitan statistical areas, putting it higher than the Bay Area.  And the segment has been a job growth boon for Colorado recently, accounting for one-third of jobs added last year, Gedney said.  ""It's clear that many of our innovation businesses, the tech industry in particular are seeing some additional growth in Boulder, and those are higher-paying jobs and very desirable for any community,"" said John Tayer, CEO of the Boulder Chamber.  Google (GOOGL) reportedly employs 1,300 people in Boulder and is looking to double its Colorado operations, the Boulder Daily Camera reported last month. Apple (AAPL) has announced plans to significantly ramp up its workforce there.  ""Along with that, we're also seeing that the rising tide lifts all boats as we have businesses move to town or grow,"" Tayer said.  On the flipside, the influx of people into a community that has long resisted growth, has driven housing prices upward and priced out longtime residents.  ""Income inequality, wealth gaps are issues that are not unique to Boulder,"" Tayer said. ""We want to see our employees earn wages that are appropriate for the work that they do."" But as Boulder's reliance on technology employment grows, area business leaders say Boulder and Colorado are more insulated now than they were during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s or the energy collapse of the 1980s. Colorado took longer to recover from the dot-com event than the Great Recession -- by about one month -- then ended up outperforming the nation in the recovery from the Great Recession, CU-Boulder economist Lewandowski said.  ""What was our shortcoming in the early 2000s ended up being our comparative advantage during the 2010s,"" he said.  Since that time, the state and Boulder Region have experienced economic growth in other industries such as natural foods, outdoor products, beverage manufacturing, as well as a longstanding contingent of federal research laboratories, said Clif Harald, of the Boulder Economic Council. ""It's a really important part of how the whole region, especially Boulder, has evolved over the last quarter century,"" he said.",3/24/2020
